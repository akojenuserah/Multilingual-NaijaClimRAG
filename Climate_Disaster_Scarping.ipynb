Career services centers have helped students in advanced nations to make informed decisions regarding their career paths,” he said.\\nAccording to him, the workshop was conceived mainly for the purpose of brainstorming over some identified areas of intervention that are seen to be highly beneficial not only to the institutions, but also to students who are the ultimate beneficiaries of all the interventions in the tertiary institutions.c\\nSpeaking further on the career centers, he said they “provide information for students on trends in the job market, opportunities, and requisite skills as well as linkages with the employment industries including the alumni of the institutions.\\n“They provide students with tools for self-assessment to identify their interests, strengths, weaknesses and prospects. Career centers further provide counselling, guidance, and support to all students.”\\nThe TETFund boss also disclosed that “the Fund recently received a communication from the Federal Ministry of Education regarding the Presidential directive to TETFund on the support of teaching practice and the recommendations of the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission regarding the teaching practice allowance, which now includes Faculties of Education in our Universities.”\\nAccording to him, ‘while the Fund, as approved by the Board of Trustees, provided a 3 days Duty Tour Allowance to supervisors, based on the civil service recommended rate and a transportation support based on grade levels, the Salaries and Wages Commission provides for the payment of monthly stipends to supervisors and students-teachers at approved rates irrespective of rank or grade level and without provision for transport.\\n“As a directive of government, the Fund is obliged to comply and implement the content and spirit of the directive.\\nHe however noted that the issue required collective brainstorming that may lead to the reworking of the teaching practice funding template currently in use.\\n“The methodology employed in the computation of the allowance by the Fund and that of the Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission appear to be different, hence the need for harmonization to achieve shared acceptance.\\n“The Fund, by all means recognizes the significance of the inclusion of the student- teachers and the Faculties of Education which is to make the teaching profession more attractive.\\n“However, considering the impact of these provisions on our disbursement policies and processes, we will be making necessary adjustments in our disbursement guidelines going forward, in consultations with the Federal Ministry of Education,”he said.\\nAlso speaking, the National President of Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union, COEASU, Dr. Smart Olugbeko, noted that the workshop was aimed at addressing issues with emerging students’ needs on areas of career centres, teaching practice, development of hostels, among others\\nWhile commending TETFund for the implementation of career centres, he urged the centres to look into the issue of employability of students from the colleges as employers of labour have raised such concerns over it.\\n“The major area of concern which we need to look into is the are of employability of our students because it is one of the major areas of concerns employers of labour have been talking about, whether our graduates are actually employable.\\n“It is not just about the content of what we teach in our various schools, it is also about how we have prepared our graduates, our students for them to be able to teach in our various schools or became employable when they leave the various institutions.”\\nHe stressed the importance of skills development among those manning the career centres to be well equipped to train students to be able to perform such functions, adding that you can’t give what you don’t have.\\n“We are talking about the function of making them to have an active and productive interface with the industry and the society, and this will actually be able to be performed by an expert, the person that is well-equipped to carry out that task,”he said.\\nOlugbeko also appealed on TETFund to ensure uniformity in infrastructure, stating that it will not be appropriate to ask institutions to go and set up career centres without uniformity and functionality of infrastructure like the microteaching infrastruicture provided by government in all the colleges.\\n“If we allow institutions to make use of infrastructure that are not adequately designated to perform the function of career centres then we will be having career centres that are not functional.”\\nThe COEASU President further called on TETFund to upscale its monitoring and evaluation activities in the centres, warning that no matter the level of intervention provided, a deficient monitoring function will not produce anything meaningful from them.\\nFor his part, the Executive Secretary of the National Commission for Colleges of Education, Prof Paulinus Okwelle, expressed gratitude to TETFund for the intervention in career centres in CoEs and other tertiary institutions.\\nOkwelle noted that canceling in the institution has to go beyond making career choices to look at how to fit into the various career paths that can be found in education, stating that educators have more work to do now in the society than before.\\n“The expectation of a teacher is far more than what it used to be because you are dealing with a society that is so complex. So, we need to be able to apply multi-approaches to make them understand that not everything that comes their way need to be taken,”he said.\\nThe NCCE Executive Secretary also disclosed that the colleges have been empowered by law to also run degree programmes in addition to training teachers for the basic education subsector.', 'Article URL': 'https://von.gov.ng/education-tetfund-tasks-lectures-on-deployment-of-modern-technology/', 'Image_link': 'https://von.gov.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TETFUND-logo-590x354-1.jpg'}, {'Keyword': 'technology', 'Published_time': '2024-06-29T21:32:03+01:00', 'Title': 'Anambra ICT Boss Urges Local Government Officials To Embrace Technology', 'Full_Content': 'The Managing Director of the Anambra State Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Agency, Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata (CFA), has emphasized the need for local government officials to embrace technology wholeheartedly.\\nAs the world progresses, incorporating digital solutions is no longer an option but a necessity that can improve governance, enhance service delivery, and drive economic growth.\\nAgbata, who also informed them that technology has come to stay, made the call at the ongoing 2024 Local Government Service Week at the Professor Dora Akunyili Women Development Centre, Awka, the state capital. He highlighted Governor Soludo’s commitment to making Anambra’s workforce, including local government officials, tech-savvy.\\n“Technology has revolutionized various aspects of modern life, and local government administration is no exception. From streamlining bureaucratic processes to increasing operational efficiency, technology provides numerous benefits, such as enhanced communication, efficient service delivery, data management, and economic growth.\\n“Anambra State has been proactive in embracing technology, thanks to the efforts led by the ICT Agency. Recognizing that technology is revolutionizing governance practices globally, Anambra State has taken significant strides to integrate technology-driven solutions into local government administration through digitalizing services, ICT training programs, partnerships, and collaboration.”\\nElaborating on his points, Agbata said on Digitalizing Services,“The state government has introduced various online platforms and portals to digitize services, making it easier for residents to access and avail government services, pay bills, and engage with local officials. These initiatives have improved efficiency and transparency while reducing bureaucratic hurdles.”\\nOn ICT Training Programs, he stated,“The Anambra State government has launched training programs to equip local government officials with essential digital skills.

Such collaborations enable the transfer of knowledge, facilitate technology adoption, and enhance local government capabilities.”\\nAgbata highlighted the unique nature of technology as an industry that does not discriminate by age or status, noting its equalizing power and the substantial investment it requires.\\n“Technology is one space that doesn’t respect persons nor age. It is a leveller yet expensive and requires a lot of investment. This is one industry you should embrace and encourage your children to embrace too because it is a high-skilled and high-paying space. I can tell you that the average 18-21-year-old working in a regular tech company would be earning 3-4 times what I earn as an MD, and you will still be begging him or her to stay on the job.”\\nThe MD urged local government officials to support and adopt technological solutions and initiatives being rolled out by the state.\\n“I also encourage you, local government officials who are closest to the grassroots, as the state pushes out some solutions and initiatives, you should embrace them because it is for our good. No matter your field of endeavour, the one who leverages technology will be more valued than one who does not.”\\nThe Anambra ICT MD noted that by leveraging technology effectively, local governments can enhance governance, improve service delivery, and drive economic growth, ultimately leading to a better quality of life for their constituents.\\nContributing, one of the discussants, Dr. Bridget Egbosi, charged the local government officials to invest in personal development as well as digital tools such as Android phones to leverage technology and become tech-savvy while they wait for further support from the Governor.

Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Nigeria, in collaboration with other stakeholders, has opened a regional hub for fertilizers and soil health, due to concerns over the state of depleted soil which has affected food security and improved yields across West Africa.\\nDuring the launch at the IITA, agricultural experts disclosed that the hub is a combination of cutting-edge laboratory testing and training facilities with cross-sector experts to support development of advanced soil health and fertilizer technologies in West Africa and the Sahel.\\nThe experts noted that the efforts will significantly enhance agricultural productivity and sustainable profitability across West Africa with an assurance that by 2033, the hub will help increase yields and income for three million farmers, improve soil health on 1.5 million hectares of land, and equip 1.5 million farmers to adapt to climate change.\\nIn their separate remarks, the experts said the hub leverages a step-change in coordination and collaboration to tackle the critical agricultural production challenges in the region by promoting sustainable soil health and optimum fertilizer practices that will enhance the sustainability and resilience of agricultural production and food security.\\nThe Director-General, IITA, Simeon Ehui, described the regional hub as a groundbreaking step towards revolutionizing agricultural practices in West Africa and the Sahel, by leveraging IITA’s extensive research experience and collaborating with key stakeholders to empower farmers with the knowledge and tools to improve soil health and achieve sustainable food security.\\nEhui stated:“In Africa, two-thirds of the land available for agricultural production is considered degraded, resulting in low crop and livestock productivity, poverty, and degradation of natural resources. Average fertilizer application rate is 22 kilograms per hectare, compared to a world average seven-times higher (146 kilograms per hectare), while skyrocketing and highly volatile fertilizer prices reduce their application even further.\\n“Moreover, the fertilizers applied are not always suitable to the soil and crops needs, and complementary inputs and advisory services are usually missing, leading to low profitability for the farmer and sometimes even further soil degradation in the long run,”he noted.\\nThe IITA DG explained that the hub combines cutting-edge laboratory testing and training facilities with cross-sector experts, including the private sector, to support development and delivery at scale of advanced soil health and fertilizer technologies.\\nHe said:“It provides access to rigorous internal scientific research and on-farm testing, ensuring practical solutions tailored to farm-specific challenges and thereby delivering significant value to growers.”\\nAlso, the Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Agriculture at the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Mrs Massandje Toure-Litse, said the fertilizer and soil health hub is critical for agricultural development in West Africa.\\nShe stated:“By focusing on knowledge sharing, capacity development, and evidence-based practices, it perfectly aligns with the strategic guidance outlined in the Lomé Declaration on Fertilizers and Soil Health in West Africa and the Sahel, adopted on May, 2023, to empower our member states to achieve their sustainable agriculture goals.”\\nThe World Bank Regional Director for Sustainable Development, Chakib Jenane, said the bank is committed to helping achieve Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 13 to eliminate hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, and to take urgent actions to address climate change and its impacts.\\nHe noted:“Integrated soil fertility management and the restoration of soil health are therefore key to ensure the resilience of food systems and achieve food security in West Africa and the Sahel.”\\nSimilarly, the CEO of OCP Africa, Dr Mohamed Jamali, revealed that the company is demonstrating a strong commitment to sustainable agriculture and food systems in Africa, saying contributing to the establishment of the hub underscores its dedication to the goals and unconditioned commitment to making the programme a pilot to be upscaled in all the continent.\\nThe regional hub, open to partnerships with other organisations, research institutions, and private sector entities to achieve a thriving agricultural future in West Africa, is a collaborative effort initiated at the Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, on May 8, 2024, which focused on combating soil health decline in the region.\\nThe summit brought together key stakeholders, including IITA, OCP Africa, the African Plant Nutrition Institute (APNI), University Mohammed VI Polytechnic (UM6P), International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), and the World Bank.\\nThe hub is propelled by significant financial commitments, including support from the World Bank ($10 million) over the next five years through the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project, and from OCP Africa over the same period.

Career services centers have helped students in advanced nations to make informed decisions regarding their career paths,” he said.\\nAccording to him, the workshop was conceived mainly for the purpose of brainstorming over some identified areas of intervention that are seen to be highly beneficial not only to the institutions, but also to students who are the ultimate beneficiaries of all the interventions in the tertiary institutions.c\\nSpeaking further on the career centers, he said they “provide information for students on trends in the job market, opportunities, and requisite skills as well as linkages with the employment industries including the alumni of the institutions.\\n“They provide students with tools for self-assessment to identify their interests, strengths, weaknesses and prospects. Career centers further provide counselling, guidance, and support to all students.”\\nThe TETFund boss also disclosed that “the Fund recently received a communication from the Federal Ministry of Education regarding the Presidential directive to TETFund on the support of teaching practice and the recommendations of the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission regarding the teaching practice allowance, which now includes Faculties of Education in our Universities.”\\nAccording to him, ‘while the Fund, as approved by the Board of Trustees, provided a 3 days Duty Tour Allowance to supervisors, based on the civil service recommended rate and a transportation support based on grade levels, the Salaries and Wages Commission provides for the payment of monthly stipends to supervisors and students-teachers at approved rates irrespective of rank or grade level and without provision for transport.\\n“As a directive of government, the Fund is obliged to comply and implement the content and spirit of the directive.\\nHe however noted that the issue required collective brainstorming that may lead to the reworking of the teaching practice funding template currently in use.\\n“The methodology employed in the computation of the allowance by the Fund and that of the Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission appear to be different, hence the need for harmonization to achieve shared acceptance.\\n“The Fund, by all means recognizes the significance of the inclusion of the student- teachers and the Faculties of Education which is to make the teaching profession more attractive.\\n“However, considering the impact of these provisions on our disbursement policies and processes, we will be making necessary adjustments in our disbursement guidelines going forward, in consultations with the Federal Ministry of Education,”he said.\\nAlso speaking, the National President of Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union, COEASU, Dr. Smart Olugbeko, noted that the workshop was aimed at addressing issues with emerging students’ needs on areas of career centres, teaching practice, development of hostels, among others\\nWhile commending TETFund for the implementation of career centres, he urged the centres to look into the issue of employability of students from the colleges as employers of labour have raised such concerns over it.\\n“The major area of concern which we need to look into is the are of employability of our students because it is one of the major areas of concerns employers of labour have been talking about, whether our graduates are actually employable.\\n“It is not just about the content of what we teach in our various schools, it is also about how we have prepared our graduates, our students for them to be able to teach in our various schools or became employable when they leave the various institutions.”\\nHe stressed the importance of skills development among those manning the career centres to be well equipped to train students to be able to perform such functions, adding that you can’t give what you don’t have.\\n“We are talking about the function of making them to have an active and productive interface with the industry and the society, and this will actually be able to be performed by an expert, the person that is well-equipped to carry out that task,”he said.\\nOlugbeko also appealed on TETFund to ensure uniformity in infrastructure, stating that it will not be appropriate to ask institutions to go and set up career centres without uniformity and functionality of infrastructure like the microteaching infrastruicture provided by government in all the colleges.\\n“If we allow institutions to make use of infrastructure that are not adequately designated to perform the function of career centres then we will be having career centres that are not functional.”\\nThe COEASU President further called on TETFund to upscale its monitoring and evaluation activities in the centres, warning that no matter the level of intervention provided, a deficient monitoring function will not produce anything meaningful from them.\\nFor his part, the Executive Secretary of the National Commission for Colleges of Education, Prof Paulinus Okwelle, expressed gratitude to TETFund for the intervention in career centres in CoEs and other tertiary institutions.\\nOkwelle noted that canceling in the institution has to go beyond making career choices to look at how to fit into the various career paths that can be found in education, stating that educators have more work to do now in the society than before.\\n“The expectation of a teacher is far more than what it used to be because you are dealing with a society that is so complex. So, we need to be able to apply multi-approaches to make them understand that not everything that comes their way need to be taken,”he said.\\nThe NCCE Executive Secretary also disclosed that the colleges have been empowered by law to also run degree programmes in addition to training teachers for the basic education subsector.',\n",

He highlighted Governor Soludo’s commitment to making Anambra’s workforce, including local government officials, tech-savvy.\\n“Technology has revolutionized various aspects of modern life, and local government administration is no exception. From streamlining bureaucratic processes to increasing operational efficiency, technology provides numerous benefits, such as enhanced communication, efficient service delivery, data management, and economic growth.\\n“Anambra State has been proactive in embracing technology, thanks to the efforts led by the ICT Agency. Recognizing that technology is revolutionizing governance practices globally, Anambra State has taken significant strides to integrate technology-driven solutions into local government administration through digitalizing services, ICT training programs, partnerships, and collaboration.”\\nElaborating on his points, Agbata said on Digitalizing Services,“The state government has introduced various online platforms and portals to digitize services, making it easier for residents to access and avail government services, pay bills, and engage with local officials. These initiatives have improved efficiency and transparency while reducing bureaucratic hurdles.”\\nOn ICT Training Programs, he stated,“The Anambra State government has launched training programs to equip local government officials with essential digital skills. These programs aim to ensure that officials can effectively utilize technology to improve their administrative processes and better serve their constituents.”\\nAlso Read:Anambra ICT agency urges prioritization of technology\\nSpeaking further on Partnerships and Collaboration, Agbata said,“Anambra State has actively sought partnerships with private tech companies, educational institutions, and other stakeholders to leverage their expertise, resources, and innovation. Such collaborations enable the transfer of knowledge, facilitate technology adoption, and enhance local government capabilities.”\\nAgbata highlighted the unique nature of technology as an industry that does not discriminate by age or status, noting its equalizing power and the substantial investment it requires.\\n“Technology is one space that doesn’t respect persons nor age. It is a leveller yet expensive and requires a lot of investment. This is one industry you should embrace and encourage your children to embrace too because it is a high-skilled and high-paying space. I can tell you that the average 18-21-year-old working in a regular tech company would be earning 3-4 times what I earn as an MD, and you will still be begging him or her to stay on the job.”\\nThe MD urged local government officials to support and adopt technological solutions and initiatives being rolled out by the state.\\n“I also encourage you, local government officials who are closest to the grassroots, as the state pushes out some solutions and initiatives, you should embrace them because it is for our good. No matter your field of endeavour, the one who leverages technology will be more valued than one who does not.”\\nThe Anambra ICT MD noted that by leveraging technology effectively, local governments can enhance governance, improve service delivery, and drive economic growth, ultimately leading to a better quality of life for their constituents.\\nContributing, one of the discussants, Dr. Bridget Egbosi, charged the local government officials to invest in personal development as well as digital tools such as Android phones to leverage technology and become tech-savvy while they wait for further support from the Governor. She emphasized that this is a worthy investment that will bring about value rebirth in not just their personal lives but at the local government commission where they work.\\nThe Chairman of the Commission, Barrister Vin Ezeaka, commended the MD’s address and called for collective efforts to improve the local government system.',\n",

Tony Muobike, described it as a tool to actualize Governor Chukwuma Soludo’s dream of providing quality healthcare to the people of Anambra. He noted that due to its importance, the State Legislature did not waste time in passing the bill legitimizing the initiative within a month of its arrival at the assembly.\\nMuobike, while commending the State ICT Agency for its contribution to the development of the initiative’s e-platform, called on health professionals to familiarize themselves with the law and fully integrate it into their operations to avoid running afoul of it.\\n“Quackery is in many forms. Aside from those who are operating illegally, we also have registered institutions run by doctors where quackery is being practiced.\\n“The law supporting this initiative affects all professionals in the health practice and the idea is that each professional will concentrate on their specific areas of certified and proven expertise.\\n“Though there will be inspectors who will ensure compliance with the law, the public also must ensure that the law is well implemented,”he said.\\nEarlier in his remarks, the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Afam Obidike described the initiative as a regulatory system to enhance management of health facilities and practitioners in the state.\\n“Prior to this administration, almost 80 percent of healthcare services were been driven by the private sector with little or nothing to regulate them but with the advent of the Governor Soludo administration, investment in the healthcare sector have constantly been on the rise ensuring better days ahead.”\\nObidike further explained that the initiative and the accompanying e-platform are all aimed at systematically eliminating quackery in all its forms in the state health system and increasing accessibility, especially for those in rural areas.\\n“Under this initiative, we already have 326 health informants across the state who provide us information on health facilities across the state.\\n“It is unfortunate that their findings show that 45 percent of the health facilities operating in the state are not registered.\\nAlso Read:Stakeholders seek urgent action to revamp pharmaceutical industry\\n“This platform will enable residents to identify health facilities that provide services in specific areas, as well as help in reporting issues.\\n“By adopting advanced monitoring and accreditation processes, we are setting a benchmark for other states in the federation.

It supports the Federal Government’s efforts to strengthen health systems, improve service delivery, and ensure accountability in the health sector. We are proud to contribute to the realization of these national goals, which are vital for the socio-economic development of our country,”Obidike concluded.\\nIn his remarks, the Managing Director of the State ICT Agency, Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata, CFA expressed appreciation to the governor for the opportunity to demonstrate what technology can do in the health sector.\\n“Technology for sure, cannot solve all your problems but can solve so many problems. It is only dependent on what you want to achieve with it.\\n“What the ICT agency has done is to replicate the vision of the Ministry in setting up the e-platform and bringing on board, all the state assets. The idea is to ensure authenticity and eradicate quackery as much as possible,”he said.\\nCFA explained that the reason for the URL,ashefamu.anambrastate.gov.ng; is to solidify authenticity.

Career services centers have helped students in advanced nations to make informed decisions regarding their career paths,” he said.\\nAccording to him, the workshop was conceived mainly for the purpose of brainstorming over some identified areas of intervention that are seen to be highly beneficial not only to the institutions, but also to students who are the ultimate beneficiaries of all the interventions in the tertiary institutions.c\\nSpeaking further on the career centers, he said they “provide information for students on trends in the job market, opportunities, and requisite skills as well as linkages with the employment industries including the alumni of the institutions.\\n“They provide students with tools for self-assessment to identify their interests, strengths, weaknesses and prospects. Career centers further provide counselling, guidance, and support to all students.”\\nThe TETFund boss also disclosed that “the Fund recently received a communication from the Federal Ministry of Education regarding the Presidential directive to TETFund on the support of teaching practice and the recommendations of the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission regarding the teaching practice allowance, which now includes Faculties of Education in our Universities.”\\nAccording to him, ‘while the Fund, as approved by the Board of Trustees, provided a 3 days Duty Tour Allowance to supervisors, based on the civil service recommended rate and a transportation support based on grade levels, the Salaries and Wages Commission provides for the payment of monthly stipends to supervisors and students-teachers at approved rates irrespective of rank or grade level and without provision for transport.\\n“As a directive of government, the Fund is obliged to comply and implement the content and spirit of the directive.\\nHe however noted that the issue required collective brainstorming that may lead to the reworking of the teaching practice funding template currently in use.\\n“The methodology employed in the computation of the allowance by the Fund and that of the Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission appear to be different, hence the need for harmonization to achieve shared acceptance.\\n“The Fund, by all means recognizes the significance of the inclusion of the student- teachers and the Faculties of Education which is to make the teaching profession more attractive.\\n“However, considering the impact of these provisions on our disbursement policies and processes, we will be making necessary adjustments in our disbursement guidelines going forward, in consultations with the Federal Ministry of Education,”he said.\\nAlso speaking, the National President of Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union, COEASU, Dr. Smart Olugbeko, noted that the workshop was aimed at addressing issues with emerging students’ needs on areas of career centres, teaching practice, development of hostels, among others\\nWhile commending TETFund for the implementation of career centres, he urged the centres to look into the issue of employability of students from the colleges as employers of labour have raised such concerns over it.\\n“The major area of concern which we need to look into is the are of employability of our students because it is one of the major areas of concerns employers of labour have been talking about, whether our graduates are actually employable.\\n“It is not just about the content of what we teach in our various schools, it is also about how we have prepared our graduates, our students for them to be able to teach in our various schools or became employable when they leave the various institutions.”\\nHe stressed the importance of skills development among those manning the career centres to be well equipped to train students to be able to perform such functions, adding that you can’t give what you don’t have.\\n“We are talking about the function of making them to have an active and productive interface with the industry and the society, and this will actually be able to be performed by an expert, the person that is well-equipped to carry out that task,”he said.\\nOlugbeko also appealed on TETFund to ensure uniformity in infrastructure, stating that it will not be appropriate to ask institutions to go and set up career centres without uniformity and functionality of infrastructure like the microteaching infrastruicture provided by government in all the colleges.\\n“If we allow institutions to make use of infrastructure that are not adequately designated to perform the function of career centres then we will be having career centres that are not functional.”\\nThe COEASU President further called on TETFund to upscale its monitoring and evaluation activities in the centres, warning that no matter the level of intervention provided, a deficient monitoring function will not produce anything meaningful from them.\\nFor his part, the Executive Secretary of the National Commission for Colleges of Education, Prof Paulinus Okwelle, expressed gratitude to TETFund for the intervention in career centres in CoEs and other tertiary institutions.\\nOkwelle noted that canceling in the institution has to go beyond making career choices to look at how to fit into the various career paths that can be found in education, stating that educators have more work to do now in the society than before.\\n“The expectation of a teacher is far more than what it used to be because you are dealing with a society that is so complex. So, we need to be able to apply multi-approaches to make them understand that not everything that comes their way need to be taken,”he said.\\nThe NCCE Executive Secretary also disclosed that the colleges have been empowered by law to also run degree programmes in addition to training teachers for the basic education subsector.',\n",

He highlighted Governor Soludo’s commitment to making Anambra’s workforce, including local government officials, tech-savvy.\\n“Technology has revolutionized various aspects of modern life, and local government administration is no exception. From streamlining bureaucratic processes to increasing operational efficiency, technology provides numerous benefits, such as enhanced communication, efficient service delivery, data management, and economic growth.\\n“Anambra State has been proactive in embracing technology, thanks to the efforts led by the ICT Agency. Recognizing that technology is revolutionizing governance practices globally, Anambra State has taken significant strides to integrate technology-driven solutions into local government administration through digitalizing services, ICT training programs, partnerships, and collaboration.”\\nElaborating on his points, Agbata said on Digitalizing Services,“The state government has introduced various online platforms and portals to digitize services, making it easier for residents to access and avail government services, pay bills, and engage with local officials. These initiatives have improved efficiency and transparency while reducing bureaucratic hurdles.”\\nOn ICT Training Programs, he stated,“The Anambra State government has launched training programs to equip local government officials with essential digital skills.

Such collaborations enable the transfer of knowledge, facilitate technology adoption, and enhance local government capabilities.”\\nAgbata highlighted the unique nature of technology as an industry that does not discriminate by age or status, noting its equalizing power and the substantial investment it requires.\\n“Technology is one space that doesn’t respect persons nor age. It is a leveller yet expensive and requires a lot of investment. This is one industry you should embrace and encourage your children to embrace too because it is a high-skilled and high-paying space. I can tell you that the average 18-21-year-old working in a regular tech company would be earning 3-4 times what I earn as an MD, and you will still be begging him or her to stay on the job.”\\nThe MD urged local government officials to support and adopt technological solutions and initiatives being rolled out by the state.\\n“I also encourage you, local government officials who are closest to the grassroots, as the state pushes out some solutions and initiatives, you should embrace them because it is for our good. No matter your field of endeavour, the one who leverages technology will be more valued than one who does not.”\\nThe Anambra ICT MD noted that by leveraging technology effectively, local governments can enhance governance, improve service delivery, and drive economic growth, ultimately leading to a better quality of life for their constituents.\\nContributing, one of the discussants, Dr. Bridget Egbosi, charged the local government officials to invest in personal development as well as digital tools such as Android phones to leverage technology and become tech-savvy while they wait for further support from the Governor. She emphasized that this is a worthy investment that will bring about value rebirth in not just their personal lives but at the local government commission where they work.\\nThe Chairman of the Commission, Barrister Vin Ezeaka, commended the MD’s address and called for collective efforts to improve the local government system.',\n",

He noted that due to its importance, the State Legislature did not waste time in passing the bill legitimizing the initiative within a month of its arrival at the assembly.\\nMuobike, while commending the State ICT Agency for its contribution to the development of the initiative’s e-platform, called on health professionals to familiarize themselves with the law and fully integrate it into their operations to avoid running afoul of it.\\n“Quackery is in many forms. Aside from those who are operating illegally, we also have registered institutions run by doctors where quackery is being practiced.\\n“The law supporting this initiative affects all professionals in the health practice and the idea is that each professional will concentrate on their specific areas of certified and proven expertise.\\n“Though there will be inspectors who will ensure compliance with the law, the public also must ensure that the law is well implemented,”he said.\\nEarlier in his remarks, the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Afam Obidike described the initiative as a regulatory system to enhance management of health facilities and practitioners in the state.\\n“Prior to this administration, almost 80 percent of healthcare services were been driven by the private sector with little or nothing to regulate them but with the advent of the Governor Soludo administration, investment in the healthcare sector have constantly been on the rise ensuring better days ahead.”\\nObidike further explained that the initiative and the accompanying e-platform are all aimed at systematically eliminating quackery in all its forms in the state health system and increasing accessibility, especially for those in rural areas.\\n“Under this initiative, we already have 326 health informants across the state who provide us information on health facilities across the state.\\n“It is unfortunate that their findings show that 45 percent of the health facilities operating in the state are not registered.\\nAlso Read:Stakeholders seek urgent action to revamp pharmaceutical industry\\n“This platform will enable residents to identify health facilities that provide services in specific areas, as well as help in reporting issues.\\n“By adopting advanced monitoring and accreditation processes, we are setting a benchmark for other states in the federation.

Average fertilizer application rate is 22 kilograms per hectare, compared to a world average seven-times higher (146 kilograms per hectare), while skyrocketing and highly volatile fertilizer prices reduce their application even further.\\n“Moreover, the fertilizers applied are not always suitable to the soil and crops needs, and complementary inputs and advisory services are usually missing, leading to low profitability for the farmer and sometimes even further soil degradation in the long run,”he noted.\\nThe IITA DG explained that the hub combines cutting-edge laboratory testing and training facilities with cross-sector experts, including the private sector, to support development and delivery at scale of advanced soil health and fertilizer technologies.\\nHe said:“It provides access to rigorous internal scientific research and on-farm testing, ensuring practical solutions tailored to farm-specific challenges and thereby delivering significant value to growers.”\\nAlso, the Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Agriculture at the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Mrs Massandje Toure-Litse, said the fertilizer and soil health hub is critical for agricultural development in West Africa.\\nShe stated:“By focusing on knowledge sharing, capacity development, and evidence-based practices, it perfectly aligns with the strategic guidance outlined in the Lomé Declaration on Fertilizers and Soil Health in West Africa and the Sahel, adopted on May, 2023, to empower our member states to achieve their sustainable agriculture goals.”\\nThe World Bank Regional Director for Sustainable Development, Chakib Jenane, said the bank is committed to helping achieve Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 13 to eliminate hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, and to take urgent actions to address climate change and its impacts.\\nHe noted:“Integrated soil fertility management and the restoration of soil health are therefore key to ensure the resilience of food systems and achieve food security in West Africa and the Sahel.”\\nSimilarly, the CEO of OCP Africa, Dr Mohamed Jamali, revealed that the company is demonstrating a strong commitment to sustainable agriculture and food systems in Africa, saying contributing to the establishment of the hub underscores its dedication to the goals and unconditioned commitment to making the programme a pilot to be upscaled in all the continent.\\nThe regional hub, open to partnerships with other organisations, research institutions, and private sector entities to achieve a thriving agricultural future in West Africa, is a collaborative effort initiated at the Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, on May 8, 2024, which focused on combating soil health decline in the region.\\nThe summit brought together key stakeholders, including IITA, OCP Africa, the African Plant Nutrition Institute (APNI), University Mohammed VI Polytechnic (UM6P), International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), and the World Bank.\\nThe hub is propelled by significant financial commitments, including support from the World Bank ($10 million) over the next five years through the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project, and from OCP Africa over the same period. Its strategy is framed by the priorities of the Fertilizer and Soil Health Roadmap 2023 and the Nairobi Declaration from the Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit 2024.\\nThe operationalization of the hub is part of commitments signed in Marrakech in October, 2023, between the World Bank, IITA, and OCP Africa.\\nHighpoint of the event was the signing of Memorandum of Agreement by the relevant stakeholders on the operationalization and implementation of the ECOWAS Agricultural Policy.',\n",

Average fertilizer application rate is 22 kilograms per hectare, compared to a world average seven-times higher (146 kilograms per hectare), while skyrocketing and highly volatile fertilizer prices reduce their application even further.\\n“Moreover, the fertilizers applied are not always suitable to the soil and crops needs, and complementary inputs and advisory services are usually missing, leading to low profitability for the farmer and sometimes even further soil degradation in the long run,”he noted.\\nThe IITA DG explained that the hub combines cutting-edge laboratory testing and training facilities with cross-sector experts, including the private sector, to support development and delivery at scale of advanced soil health and fertilizer technologies.\\nHe said:“It provides access to rigorous internal scientific research and on-farm testing, ensuring practical solutions tailored to farm-specific challenges and thereby delivering significant value to growers.”\\nAlso, the Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Agriculture at the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Mrs Massandje Toure-Litse, said the fertilizer and soil health hub is critical for agricultural development in West Africa.\\nShe stated:“By focusing on knowledge sharing, capacity development, and evidence-based practices, it perfectly aligns with the strategic guidance outlined in the Lomé Declaration on Fertilizers and Soil Health in West Africa and the Sahel, adopted on May, 2023, to empower our member states to achieve their sustainable agriculture goals.”\\nThe World Bank Regional Director for Sustainable Development, Chakib Jenane, said the bank is committed to helping achieve Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 13 to eliminate hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, and to take urgent actions to address climate change and its impacts.\\nHe noted:“Integrated soil fertility management and the restoration of soil health are therefore key to ensure the resilience of food systems and achieve food security in West Africa and the Sahel.”\\nSimilarly, the CEO of OCP Africa, Dr Mohamed Jamali, revealed that the company is demonstrating a strong commitment to sustainable agriculture and food systems in Africa, saying contributing to the establishment of the hub underscores its dedication to the goals and unconditioned commitment to making the programme a pilot to be upscaled in all the continent.\\nThe regional hub, open to partnerships with other organisations, research institutions, and private sector entities to achieve a thriving agricultural future in West Africa, is a collaborative effort initiated at the Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, on May 8, 2024, which focused on combating soil health decline in the region.\\nThe summit brought together key stakeholders, including IITA, OCP Africa, the African Plant Nutrition Institute (APNI), University Mohammed VI Polytechnic (UM6P), International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), and the World Bank.\\nThe hub is propelled by significant financial commitments, including support from the World Bank ($10 million) over the next five years through the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project, and from OCP Africa over the same period. Its strategy is framed by the priorities of the Fertilizer and Soil Health Roadmap 2023 and the Nairobi Declaration from the Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit 2024.\\nThe operationalization of the hub is part of commitments signed in Marrakech in October, 2023, between the World Bank, IITA, and OCP Africa.\\nHighpoint of the event was the signing of Memorandum of Agreement by the relevant stakeholders on the operationalization and implementation of the ECOWAS Agricultural Policy.',\n",

Remarkably, Niger State has more mechanization and tractors than the rest of Nigeria combined, showcasing the region’s significant progress in agricultural development”. He stated.\\nHe also mentioned partnerships with various organizations to improve the nutritional value of crops.\\n“Collaborations with entities like IITA and World Bank aim to develop and distribute fortified maize and cowpea, which are richer in nutrients. These efforts are intended to create a value chain in nutrition, ensuring that even the most common foods provide essential nutrients to the local population”.He said.\\nAddressing broader challenges, Governor Bago highlighted factors such as population growth, climate change, and economic shocks that contribute to food insecurity and malnutrition. He called for a strategic approach to food reserves, suggesting that the government must plan and allocate land for farming specifically for strategic reserves.\\nHe criticized the current state of food reserves and emphasized the need for a deliberate and coordinated effort to stabilize food prices and ensure food availability.\\nAdditionally, Bago advocated for a focus on primary health care and nutrition, suggesting that providing nutritious meals at health centers could be more beneficial than merely distributing medicine.\\nThe Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mohammad Mahmood Abubakar, represented by Mrs. Fatima Sugra, Director of Nutrition and Food Safety at the ministry presented key measures and ongoing efforts. She emphasized the grim statistics of malnutrition exacerbated by persistent violence, early marriages, high childbirth rates, climate change, and inadequate coordination among stakeholders.\\n“Despite these challenges, the federal government’s declaration of a state of emergency and collaborative efforts with state governments and various ministries to tackle the crisis effectively”.She said.\\nMrs. Sugra outlined a comprehensive approach to improve agricultural production and nutrition.“Short-term measures include distributing improved seed varieties and fertilizers to farmers, promoting homestead gardening, and enhancing livestock production.\\nMedium-term strategies focus on improved mechanization, irrigation, urban agriculture, and increased financial support for nutrient-dense food production”.\\n“Long-term goals aim to develop cooperative models, establish disease-free zones, and promote biofortification of staple crops to address micronutrient deficiencies”.\\nShe underscored the importance of collaboration and partnerships at all levels of government and with key stakeholders.\\nThe dialogue underscored the government’s resolve to tackle malnutrition through a robust and coordinated effort, reflecting a broader vision of health and prosperity for all Nigerians.',\n",

Career services centers have helped students in advanced nations to make informed decisions regarding their career paths,” he said.\\nAccording to him, the workshop was conceived mainly for the purpose of brainstorming over some identified areas of intervention that are seen to be highly beneficial not only to the institutions, but also to students who are the ultimate beneficiaries of all the interventions in the tertiary institutions.c\\nSpeaking further on the career centers, he said they “provide information for students on trends in the job market, opportunities, and requisite skills as well as linkages with the employment industries including the alumni of the institutions.\\n“They provide students with tools for self-assessment to identify their interests, strengths, weaknesses and prospects. Career centers further provide counselling, guidance, and support to all students.”\\nThe TETFund boss also disclosed that “the Fund recently received a communication from the Federal Ministry of Education regarding the Presidential directive to TETFund on the support of teaching practice and the recommendations of the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission regarding the teaching practice allowance, which now includes Faculties of Education in our Universities.”\\nAccording to him, ‘while the Fund, as approved by the Board of Trustees, provided a 3 days Duty Tour Allowance to supervisors, based on the civil service recommended rate and a transportation support based on grade levels, the Salaries and Wages Commission provides for the payment of monthly stipends to supervisors and students-teachers at approved rates irrespective of rank or grade level and without provision for transport.\\n“As a directive of government, the Fund is obliged to comply and implement the content and spirit of the directive.\\nHe however noted that the issue required collective brainstorming that may lead to the reworking of the teaching practice funding template currently in use.\\n“The methodology employed in the computation of the allowance by the Fund and that of the Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission appear to be different, hence the need for harmonization to achieve shared acceptance.\\n“The Fund, by all means recognizes the significance of the inclusion of the student- teachers and the Faculties of Education which is to make the teaching profession more attractive.\\n“However, considering the impact of these provisions on our disbursement policies and processes, we will be making necessary adjustments in our disbursement guidelines going forward, in consultations with the Federal Ministry of Education,”he said.\\nAlso speaking, the National President of Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union, COEASU, Dr. Smart Olugbeko, noted that the workshop was aimed at addressing issues with emerging students’ needs on areas of career centres, teaching practice, development of hostels, among others\\nWhile commending TETFund for the implementation of career centres, he urged the centres to look into the issue of employability of students from the colleges as employers of labour have raised such concerns over it.\\n“The major area of concern which we need to look into is the are of employability of our students because it is one of the major areas of concerns employers of labour have been talking about, whether our graduates are actually employable.\\n“It is not just about the content of what we teach in our various schools, it is also about how we have prepared our graduates, our students for them to be able to teach in our various schools or became employable when they leave the various institutions.”\\nHe stressed the importance of skills development among those manning the career centres to be well equipped to train students to be able to perform such functions, adding that you can’t give what you don’t have.\\n“We are talking about the function of making them to have an active and productive interface with the industry and the society, and this will actually be able to be performed by an expert, the person that is well-equipped to carry out that task,”he said.\\nOlugbeko also appealed on TETFund to ensure uniformity in infrastructure, stating that it will not be appropriate to ask institutions to go and set up career centres without uniformity and functionality of infrastructure like the microteaching infrastruicture provided by government in all the colleges.\\n“If we allow institutions to make use of infrastructure that are not adequately designated to perform the function of career centres then we will be having career centres that are not functional.”\\nThe COEASU President further called on TETFund to upscale its monitoring and evaluation activities in the centres, warning that no matter the level of intervention provided, a deficient monitoring function will not produce anything meaningful from them.\\nFor his part, the Executive Secretary of the National Commission for Colleges of Education, Prof Paulinus Okwelle, expressed gratitude to TETFund for the intervention in career centres in CoEs and other tertiary institutions.\\nOkwelle noted that canceling in the institution has to go beyond making career choices to look at how to fit into the various career paths that can be found in education, stating that educators have more work to do now in the society than before.\\n“The expectation of a teacher is far more than what it used to be because you are dealing with a society that is so complex.

We wanted something that would help young children get educated on tax and be interested.\\n“So, what we are hoping is that by next year, by the time we are doing this again, we have a larger number of schools.”\\nAccording to Thomas, the Tax Trybe is a club created to instil tax culture in secondary school students.\\nShe explained that out of the 20 schools that started the programme, only 12 were able to come for the competition.\\n“We are planning to expand the number of schools from 20 to 60 by the end of next year and then we would have more people participate in this competition so that we can now go global and expand to other cities around us,”Thomas explained.\\nShe maintained that the programme also aimed at raising better adults who are more consciously and socially aware of the right way to do things.\\n“We think that a lot of us might have given them a wrong impression. We are trying to make Lagos start to own responsibilities within Nigeria. The children here will go to other States so they will be able to leave Nigeria with a good name and good reputation all around,”she stated.\\nAlso, the Director of Informal Sector and Special Duties, LIRS, Dr Folashade Coker, expressed delight with the Tax Trybe initiative, noting that it would help to catch and educate those children at a young age.\\n“I am very impressed with what Tax Trybe is doing because we have to catch these children early. We want to ensure that as they grow up, they must inculcate those characters and habits,”she remarked.\\nCoker maintained that the programme was laudable, adding that it would enlighten the students and at the same time, their parents.\\n“The schools also will be able to appreciate what the state government is doing and the efforts of their teachers while their teachers will also apply to the tax laws.\\n“The impact it would have on the educational sector is to see the children thrive. A lot of children have decided what their careers would be and even beyond that, it will help them, form them and mould them to help them in public speaking,”she added.\\nExpressing her joy, the winner of the debate competition, Ishola Damilola, from Majidun Senior Grammar School, Ikorodu, Lagos State, Southwest, Nigeria, said the competition had broadened her horizon on the need to pay taxes as a good citizen.\\n“I am so happy to be here and I want to use this medium to thank the LIRS and Tax Trybe for allowing me to show my talent. I want to thank my teachers for giving me the courage,”Damilola said.\\nOther winners included Lagos Senior College and Wesley Girls Senior Secondary School, which emerged first and second runners-up, respectively.\\nPunch news/Olusola Akintonde',\n",

              "  'Full_Content': 'The Niger State government in north-central Nigeria has introduced an initiative to enhance the teaching profession in the state by improving educational infrastructure and teacher’s welfare across the 25 local government areas.\\nThe Chairman of the Niger State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Alhaji Muhammad Ibrahim, announced this during a workshop organised for teachers in the state.\\nAlhaji Muhammad Ibrahim said the multi-faceted approach by SUBEB is designed to address the myriad challenges faced by educators and ensure that schools are well-equipped to provide high-quality education.\\nHe added that the initiative will also focus on upgrading school infrastructure and providing teachers with training to help reposition the educational sector in the state.\\nAccording to him, the state government is committed to enhancing the infrastructure of over 3,000 schools across the 25 local government areas. This includes the construction of modern facilities and the refurbishment of existing structures to create conducive learning environments.\\nMuhammad further explained that a significant focus will be placed on teacher training. Recognising that many teachers have not received refresher courses in decades, the government plans to implement continuous professional development programs to ensure educators are up-to-date with the latest teaching methodologies and educational advancements.\\nHe emphasised that the successful implementation of these initiatives is crucial.“The state government emphasizes that without proper operationalization, even the best-intentioned programs could fail. Therefore, a collaborative effort involving all stakeholders is essential to ensure these plans are effectively executed.”\\nThe Chairman added that to enhance the welfare of teachers, the government is introducing several support measures, which include housing and transportation. Each teacher will have access to housing and transportation without any deductions from their salaries.\\nThe SUBEB Chairman said teachers will be encouraged to engage in agricultural activities, supported by government partnerships to provide inputs and guidance. The profits from these ventures will be used to fund their housing and transportation needs.\\nAlhaji Muhammad Ibrahim said, “Teachers will be categorised based on skill sets and performance, encouraging continuous improvement and rewarding excellence.”\\nThe Chairman further stated that the government also plans to utilise existing bilingual education centers to expand educational opportunities. This involves integrating federal government intervention programmes and establishing at least one bilingual center in every local government area in the state.\\nHe said the initiative encourages teachers to form cooperatives, which can lead to additional resources and support, such as access to shared agricultural equipment.\\n“This approach not only provides financial benefits to teachers but also fosters community development and cooperation.”\\nHe, therefore, urged the teachers in the state to abide by the laid-down rules as strict measures will be in place to ensure accountability. Teachers caught misusing resources or engaging in fraudulent activities will face severe consequences, including dismissal from the program and prosecution.\\n“The government is optimistic that these reforms will significantly improve the quality of education in Niger State and create a better working environment for teachers.”\\n“By addressing both infrastructure and welfare, the initiative aims to lay a strong foundation for future prosperity and development in the education sector.”\\nDominica Nwabufo',\n",

Career services centers have helped students in advanced nations to make informed decisions regarding their career paths,” he said.\\nAccording to him, the workshop was conceived mainly for the purpose of brainstorming over some identified areas of intervention that are seen to be highly beneficial not only to the institutions, but also to students who are the ultimate beneficiaries of all the interventions in the tertiary institutions.c\\nSpeaking further on the career centers, he said they “provide information for students on trends in the job market, opportunities, and requisite skills as well as linkages with the employment industries including the alumni of the institutions.\\n“They provide students with tools for self-assessment to identify their interests, strengths, weaknesses and prospects.

So, we need to be able to apply multi-approaches to make them understand that not everything that comes their way need to be taken,”he said.\\nThe NCCE Executive Secretary also disclosed that the colleges have been empowered by law to also run degree programmes in addition to training teachers for the basic education subsector.',\n",

This includes the construction of modern facilities and the refurbishment of existing structures to create conducive learning environments.\\nMuhammad further explained that a significant focus will be placed on teacher training. Recognising that many teachers have not received refresher courses in decades, the government plans to implement continuous professional development programs to ensure educators are up-to-date with the latest teaching methodologies and educational advancements.\\nHe emphasised that the successful implementation of these initiatives is crucial.“The state government emphasizes that without proper operationalization, even the best-intentioned programs could fail. Therefore, a collaborative effort involving all stakeholders is essential to ensure these plans are effectively executed.”\\nThe Chairman added that to enhance the welfare of teachers, the government is introducing several support measures, which include housing and transportation. Each teacher will have access to housing and transportation without any deductions from their salaries.\\nThe SUBEB Chairman said teachers will be encouraged to engage in agricultural activities, supported by government partnerships to provide inputs and guidance. The profits from these ventures will be used to fund their housing and transportation needs.\\nAlhaji Muhammad Ibrahim said, “Teachers will be categorised based on skill sets and performance, encouraging continuous improvement and rewarding excellence.”\\nThe Chairman further stated that the government also plans to utilise existing bilingual education centers to expand educational opportunities. This involves integrating federal government intervention programmes and establishing at least one bilingual center in every local government area in the state.\\nHe said the initiative encourages teachers to form cooperatives, which can lead to additional resources and support, such as access to shared agricultural equipment.\\n“This approach not only provides financial benefits to teachers but also fosters community development and cooperation.”\\nHe, therefore, urged the teachers in the state to abide by the laid-down rules as strict measures will be in place to ensure accountability. Teachers caught misusing resources or engaging in fraudulent activities will face severe consequences, including dismissal from the program and prosecution.\\n“The government is optimistic that these reforms will significantly improve the quality of education in Niger State and create a better working environment for teachers.”\\n“By addressing both infrastructure and welfare, the initiative aims to lay a strong foundation for future prosperity and development in the education sector.”\\nDominica Nwabufo',\n",
