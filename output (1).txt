        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

        "Full_Content": "The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has commenced building emergency shelters across the nine Niger Delta states to aid flood victims.\nThe states are Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers.\nDr Samual Ogbuku, the Managing Director of NDDC, disclosed this at a one-day workshop in Port Harcourt on Tuesday, focusing on implementing a regional flood disaster emergency response strategy.\nHe said that the Niger Delta was faced with an existential threat due to climate change, which could potentially devastate the region and have an enormous social-economic impact.\n\u201cHence, the commission is currently building multi-purpose emergency shelters across the Niger Delta to provide assistance to flood victims.\n\u201cThese emergency shelters, designed to accommodate over 1,000 people, will serve as a temporary refuge during flood emergencies,\u201dhe said.\nOgbuku disclosed that the facility in each of the states would be equipped with essential amenities such as school, hospital, cafeteria, police post, and recreation centre.\n\u201cWhen completed, these emergency shelters will provide temporary accommodation and necessary services to communities during emergencies.\n\u201cWe realized that displaced people often seek refuge in school buildings during floods, forcing schools to suspend academic activities at great cost,\u201dhe stressed.\nThe managing director said that the workshop, focused on enhancing resilience in mitigating flood disasters in the region, underscored NDDC\u2019s commitment to addressing the challenge.\nAccording to him, the flood mitigation was crucial, given the region\u2019s topography and proximity to water bodies that made it susceptible to frequent flooding.\n\u201cCoastal and riverine communities, situated in low-lying areas, are at significant risk, with data showing over 100 fatalities between January 2021 and April 2023 due to flooding.\n\u201cAs we approach the peak of the rainy season, urgent measures are necessary to minimize flood impact, with collaboration among organisations and communities essential in this effort,\u201dhe said.\nOgbuku urged for partnership with the local communities, state governments, non-governmental organisations and international partners to tackle the disaster.\nMr Onuoha Obeka, Director of Environmental Control and Protection at NDDC, said that the workshop served as a platform for sharing knowledge, understanding best practices and adopting innovative strategies.\nHe emphasized that the adoption of innovative strategies would strengthen emergency response mechanisms for sustainable recovery post-flood disasters.\n\u201cInstalling water level gauges and sensors strategically around river systems will provide early flood warning.\n\u201cThese early warning will facilitate the timely evacuation of people before considerable havoc is done,\u201dhe said.\nOn his part, Prof. Andrew Obafemi, former National President of the Nigeria Cartographic Association, stressed the importance of sharing information and data to reduce flooding effects.\nHe recommenced the Niger Delta Environmental Survey plan as a crucial project to develop a reliable data bank for addressing flooding in the NDDC states.\nNAN / Foluke Ibitomi",

Sometimes we fall into the water and risk drowning. We\u2019re asking the State to help us with this customs road.\u201d\nFaced with this suffering, more and more people are calling on the Congolese government to urgently find a solution to ease traffic between the two countries and help local residents, especially small traders.\n\u201cWe sleep under tents with the children, we suffer a lot because we have nowhere to go. Even to go to the market, we have to take a canoe. If you don\u2019t have money, you have to swim. The women are suffering from infections and we\u2019re desperate.\u201d\nThe South Kivu provincial government, through its spokesman, acknowledged the consequences of the rising water levels at the border.\n\u201cThere were pillars already built that were submerged every time the water rose and blocked the work.\nA bridge is under construction to allow regular crossings.

Abdullahi Jikamshi stated this at the inauguration of the 2024 sanitation exercise by the corps at the Yahaya Sabo Bus Terminal Lafia the state capital.\nHe explained that the corp members who turned out in large numbers had cleared drainage and cleaned all dirt within and outside the motor park.\n\u201cThis exercise is going on simultaneously in motor parks and markets in the 13 Local Government Areas (LGAs) as directed by the Director General of the corps,\u201dhe noted.\nThe coordinator also directed their Environmental Sanitation Protection Community Service Club to make environmental sanitation a continued exercise in their respective communities to change the psyche of the people.\n\u201cIf the psyche of the people is changed and their consciousness of the exercise aroused, sanitation will be made to be part of their schedule and part of their lives,\u201dhe said.\nThe NYSC coordinator noted that most times flooding occurred as a result of the deliberate blocking of drains as well as building structures on waterways.\nHe also called on the leadership of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) to provide waste bins in motor parks to ensure proper waste dumps.\n\u201cApart from removing dirt in the drains and cleaning the environment, we intend to reawake the consciousness of sanitation among Nigerians through sensitization.\n\u201cWe believe that cleanliness is next to Godliness, hence the need for all to always clean our environments to prevent flooding and guard against outbreak of diseases,\u201dhe added.\nHe therefore lauded the state government and others who supported the corp members with tools for the success of the exercise.\nPermanent Secretary (PS) Nasarawa State Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Garba Mohammed, said the sanitation exercise was a topmost priority to Gov.

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Full_Content": "The Minister of the Nigerian Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Mr Nyesom Wike, has given a matching order for the immediate reconstruction of Dogon Gada box culvert in Lokogoma village, Abuja.\nThe Coordinator, Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC), Mr Felix Obuah, made this known in Abuja, during the 2024 Flood Risk Assessment and Community Awareness Campaign.\nThe campaign was organized by the FCT Emergency Management Department in collaboration with emergency management stakeholders.\nThe culvert was on the access road that linked over 3,000 residents of Lokogoma village, popularly known as Dogon Gada community to Ring Road II.\nThe FCT Emergency Management Department had on April 7, barricaded the box culvert, which had collapsed, to avert loss of lives.\nThe community loses their loved ones to flooding while trying to cross the culvert during the rainy season, due to its low elevation and prone to flooding.\nObuah said that the construction of the bridge would commence immediately after the engineering department concluded their structural designs and other technical requirements.\nHe assured the community that FEMD was taking necessary action to ensure that no life was lost to flooding in FCT throughout the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cThe minister has given a matching order that the construction of the bride should commence with immediate effect.\n\u201cAs I speak to you, any moment from now work will commence. The engineering process has begun already for the speedy construction of the bridge,\u201dhe said.\nThe coordinator pointed out that human action has an impact on the environment, exposing it to varying degrees of flood risk.\nHe explained that the exercise was a preparedness and awareness campaign to sensitize residents against actions that would predispose communities to flood.\n\u201cI assured FCT residents that with the proactive measure being taken by FEMD and other stakeholders, no life will be lost in 2024 to flooding in 2024.\n\u201cWe must, therefore, continue to strengthen our collaboration towards flood prevention and mitigation,\u201dObuah said.\nEarlier, acting Director-General, FEMD, Mr Mohammed Sabo, said that the flood risk assessment and awareness campaign was part of strategies to strengthen disaster risk reduction.\nSabo said that other flood prone communities would also be sensitized to mobilize residents to take proactive steps towards preventing loss of lives to flood.\nHe added that the flood risk assessment would enable FEMD to assess interventions that worked and areas that need additional interventions to prevent flooding.\nAlso, Mr Florence Wenegieme, Director, Forecasting, Response and Mitigation, said that the bridge had taken many lives over the years during the rainy season.\nWenegiene explained that the people were killed by the flood because they tried to cross the flooded bridge against warnings by FEMD and local divers stationed at the bridge.\nMr Christopher Maikalangu, Chairman, Abuja Municipal Area Council, thanked Wike for the prompt intervention to prevent more people from dying from flooding along the bridge.\nHe said that the distance from the community to Ring Road II was 800 metres, but the residents had to travel five to six kilometres through alternative routes to get to the ring road.\nThe leader of the community, Mr Irimiya Kanpani, who could not hide his excitement over the minister\u2019s approval for the recommendation of the collapsed bridge described it as a huge relief,\n\u201cNow I can go to sleep knowing that the minister will fulfil his promise and my people will be safe. All I can say is thank you,\u201dhe said.",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

Abdullahi Jikamshi stated this at the inauguration of the 2024 sanitation exercise by the corps at the Yahaya Sabo Bus Terminal Lafia the state capital.\nHe explained that the corp members who turned out in large numbers had cleared drainage and cleaned all dirt within and outside the motor park.\n\u201cThis exercise is going on simultaneously in motor parks and markets in the 13 Local Government Areas (LGAs) as directed by the Director General of the corps,\u201dhe noted.\nThe coordinator also directed their Environmental Sanitation Protection Community Service Club to make environmental sanitation a continued exercise in their respective communities to change the psyche of the people.\n\u201cIf the psyche of the people is changed and their consciousness of the exercise aroused, sanitation will be made to be part of their schedule and part of their lives,\u201dhe said.\nThe NYSC coordinator noted that most times flooding occurred as a result of the deliberate blocking of drains as well as building structures on waterways.\nHe also called on the leadership of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) to provide waste bins in motor parks to ensure proper waste dumps.\n\u201cApart from removing dirt in the drains and cleaning the environment, we intend to reawake the consciousness of sanitation among Nigerians through sensitization.\n\u201cWe believe that cleanliness is next to Godliness, hence the need for all to always clean our environments to prevent flooding and guard against outbreak of diseases,\u201dhe added.\nHe therefore lauded the state government and others who supported the corp members with tools for the success of the exercise.\nPermanent Secretary (PS) Nasarawa State Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Garba Mohammed, said the sanitation exercise was a topmost priority to Gov. Abdullahi Sule-led administration.\nHe explained that the governor had reintroduced a sanitation exercise on the last Saturday of every month immediately after he assumed office in 2019 to ensure the state was clean at all times.\nMohammed also called on the management of all motor parks in the state to provide waste bins for proper disposal of refuge.\nThe Permanent Secretary therefore commended NYSC for the support and promised that the government would continue to partner with individuals and groups interested in keeping the state clean.",

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

Even to go to the market, we have to take a canoe. If you don\u2019t have money, you have to swim. The women are suffering from infections and we\u2019re desperate.\u201d\nThe South Kivu provincial government, through its spokesman, acknowledged the consequences of the rising water levels at the border.\n\u201cThere were pillars already built that were submerged every time the water rose and blocked the work.\nA bridge is under construction to allow regular crossings. What has been done at Kamvinvira can also be done at Sange, so we\u2019re not standing still and are always looking for solutions. As long as the government is present, solutions will always be found.\u201d\nAs the provincial government seeks a solution to this problem, the Kamvinvira border remains the main access route to Bujumbura for many travellers, as Burundi has closed its other borders with Rwanda.\nAfricanews/Hauwa M.",

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

        "Full_Content": "The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has commenced building emergency shelters across the nine Niger Delta states to aid flood victims.\nThe states are Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers.\nDr Samual Ogbuku, the Managing Director of NDDC, disclosed this at a one-day workshop in Port Harcourt on Tuesday, focusing on implementing a regional flood disaster emergency response strategy.\nHe said that the Niger Delta was faced with an existential threat due to climate change, which could potentially devastate the region and have an enormous social-economic impact.\n\u201cHence, the commission is currently building multi-purpose emergency shelters across the Niger Delta to provide assistance to flood victims.\n\u201cThese emergency shelters, designed to accommodate over 1,000 people, will serve as a temporary refuge during flood emergencies,\u201dhe said.\nOgbuku disclosed that the facility in each of the states would be equipped with essential amenities such as school, hospital, cafeteria, police post, and recreation centre.\n\u201cWhen completed, these emergency shelters will provide temporary accommodation and necessary services to communities during emergencies.\n\u201cWe realized that displaced people often seek refuge in school buildings during floods, forcing schools to suspend academic activities at great cost,\u201dhe stressed.\nThe managing director said that the workshop, focused on enhancing resilience in mitigating flood disasters in the region, underscored NDDC\u2019s commitment to addressing the challenge.\nAccording to him, the flood mitigation was crucial, given the region\u2019s topography and proximity to water bodies that made it susceptible to frequent flooding.\n\u201cCoastal and riverine communities, situated in low-lying areas, are at significant risk, with data showing over 100 fatalities between January 2021 and April 2023 due to flooding.\n\u201cAs we approach the peak of the rainy season, urgent measures are necessary to minimize flood impact, with collaboration among organisations and communities essential in this effort,\u201dhe said.\nOgbuku urged for partnership with the local communities, state governments, non-governmental organisations and international partners to tackle the disaster.\nMr Onuoha Obeka, Director of Environmental Control and Protection at NDDC, said that the workshop served as a platform for sharing knowledge, understanding best practices and adopting innovative strategies.\nHe emphasized that the adoption of innovative strategies would strengthen emergency response mechanisms for sustainable recovery post-flood disasters.\n\u201cInstalling water level gauges and sensors strategically around river systems will provide early flood warning.\n\u201cThese early warning will facilitate the timely evacuation of people before considerable havoc is done,\u201dhe said.\nOn his part, Prof. Andrew Obafemi, former National President of the Nigeria Cartographic Association, stressed the importance of sharing information and data to reduce flooding effects.\nHe recommenced the Niger Delta Environmental Survey plan as a crucial project to develop a reliable data bank for addressing flooding in the NDDC states.\nNAN / Foluke Ibitomi",

Sometimes we fall into the water and risk drowning. We\u2019re asking the State to help us with this customs road.\u201d\nFaced with this suffering, more and more people are calling on the Congolese government to urgently find a solution to ease traffic between the two countries and help local residents, especially small traders.\n\u201cWe sleep under tents with the children, we suffer a lot because we have nowhere to go. Even to go to the market, we have to take a canoe. If you don\u2019t have money, you have to swim.

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

Sometimes we fall into the water and risk drowning. We\u2019re asking the State to help us with this customs road.\u201d\nFaced with this suffering, more and more people are calling on the Congolese government to urgently find a solution to ease traffic between the two countries and help local residents, especially small traders.\n\u201cWe sleep under tents with the children, we suffer a lot because we have nowhere to go.

We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

The engineering process has begun already for the speedy construction of the bridge,\u201dhe said.\nThe coordinator pointed out that human action has an impact on the environment, exposing it to varying degrees of flood risk.\nHe explained that the exercise was a preparedness and awareness campaign to sensitize residents against actions that would predispose communities to flood.\n\u201cI assured FCT residents that with the proactive measure being taken by FEMD and other stakeholders, no life will be lost in 2024 to flooding in 2024.\n\u201cWe must, therefore, continue to strengthen our collaboration towards flood prevention and mitigation,\u201dObuah said.\nEarlier, acting Director-General, FEMD, Mr Mohammed Sabo, said that the flood risk assessment and awareness campaign was part of strategies to strengthen disaster risk reduction.\nSabo said that other flood prone communities would also be sensitized to mobilize residents to take proactive steps towards preventing loss of lives to flood.\nHe added that the flood risk assessment would enable FEMD to assess interventions that worked and areas that need additional interventions to prevent flooding.\nAlso, Mr Florence Wenegieme, Director, Forecasting, Response and Mitigation, said that the bridge had taken many lives over the years during the rainy season.\nWenegiene explained that the people were killed by the flood because they tried to cross the flooded bridge against warnings by FEMD and local divers stationed at the bridge.\nMr Christopher Maikalangu, Chairman, Abuja Municipal Area Council, thanked Wike for the prompt intervention to prevent more people from dying from flooding along the bridge.\nHe said that the distance from the community to Ring Road II was 800 metres, but the residents had to travel five to six kilometres through alternative routes to get to the ring road.\nThe leader of the community, Mr Irimiya Kanpani, who could not hide his excitement over the minister\u2019s approval for the recommendation of the collapsed bridge described it as a huge relief,\n\u201cNow I can go to sleep knowing that the minister will fulfil his promise and my people will be safe. All I can say is thank you,\u201dhe said.",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

The women are suffering from infections and we\u2019re desperate.\u201d\nThe South Kivu provincial government, through its spokesman, acknowledged the consequences of the rising water levels at the border.\n\u201cThere were pillars already built that were submerged every time the water rose and blocked the work.\nA bridge is under construction to allow regular crossings. What has been done at Kamvinvira can also be done at Sange, so we\u2019re not standing still and are always looking for solutions. As long as the government is present, solutions will always be found.\u201d\nAs the provincial government seeks a solution to this problem, the Kamvinvira border remains the main access route to Bujumbura for many travellers, as Burundi has closed its other borders with Rwanda.\nAfricanews/Hauwa M.",

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

        "Full_Content": "The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has commenced building emergency shelters across the nine Niger Delta states to aid flood victims.\nThe states are Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers.\nDr Samual Ogbuku, the Managing Director of NDDC, disclosed this at a one-day workshop in Port Harcourt on Tuesday, focusing on implementing a regional flood disaster emergency response strategy.\nHe said that the Niger Delta was faced with an existential threat due to climate change, which could potentially devastate the region and have an enormous social-economic impact.\n\u201cHence, the commission is currently building multi-purpose emergency shelters across the Niger Delta to provide assistance to flood victims.\n\u201cThese emergency shelters, designed to accommodate over 1,000 people, will serve as a temporary refuge during flood emergencies,\u201dhe said.\nOgbuku disclosed that the facility in each of the states would be equipped with essential amenities such as school, hospital, cafeteria, police post, and recreation centre.\n\u201cWhen completed, these emergency shelters will provide temporary accommodation and necessary services to communities during emergencies.\n\u201cWe realized that displaced people often seek refuge in school buildings during floods, forcing schools to suspend academic activities at great cost,\u201dhe stressed.\nThe managing director said that the workshop, focused on enhancing resilience in mitigating flood disasters in the region, underscored NDDC\u2019s commitment to addressing the challenge.\nAccording to him, the flood mitigation was crucial, given the region\u2019s topography and proximity to water bodies that made it susceptible to frequent flooding.\n\u201cCoastal and riverine communities, situated in low-lying areas, are at significant risk, with data showing over 100 fatalities between January 2021 and April 2023 due to flooding.\n\u201cAs we approach the peak of the rainy season, urgent measures are necessary to minimize flood impact, with collaboration among organisations and communities essential in this effort,\u201dhe said.\nOgbuku urged for partnership with the local communities, state governments, non-governmental organisations and international partners to tackle the disaster.\nMr Onuoha Obeka, Director of Environmental Control and Protection at NDDC, said that the workshop served as a platform for sharing knowledge, understanding best practices and adopting innovative strategies.\nHe emphasized that the adoption of innovative strategies would strengthen emergency response mechanisms for sustainable recovery post-flood disasters.\n\u201cInstalling water level gauges and sensors strategically around river systems will provide early flood warning.\n\u201cThese early warning will facilitate the timely evacuation of people before considerable havoc is done,\u201dhe said.\nOn his part, Prof. Andrew Obafemi, former National President of the Nigeria Cartographic Association, stressed the importance of sharing information and data to reduce flooding effects.\nHe recommenced the Niger Delta Environmental Survey plan as a crucial project to develop a reliable data bank for addressing flooding in the NDDC states.\nNAN / Foluke Ibitomi",

Sometimes we fall into the water and risk drowning. We\u2019re asking the State to help us with this customs road.\u201d\nFaced with this suffering, more and more people are calling on the Congolese government to urgently find a solution to ease traffic between the two countries and help local residents, especially small traders.\n\u201cWe sleep under tents with the children, we suffer a lot because we have nowhere to go. Even to go to the market, we have to take a canoe. If you don\u2019t have money, you have to swim.

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

Sometimes we fall into the water and risk drowning. We\u2019re asking the State to help us with this customs road.\u201d\nFaced with this suffering, more and more people are calling on the Congolese government to urgently find a solution to ease traffic between the two countries and help local residents, especially small traders.\n\u201cWe sleep under tents with the children, we suffer a lot because we have nowhere to go.

We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

The engineering process has begun already for the speedy construction of the bridge,\u201dhe said.\nThe coordinator pointed out that human action has an impact on the environment, exposing it to varying degrees of flood risk.\nHe explained that the exercise was a preparedness and awareness campaign to sensitize residents against actions that would predispose communities to flood.\n\u201cI assured FCT residents that with the proactive measure being taken by FEMD and other stakeholders, no life will be lost in 2024 to flooding in 2024.\n\u201cWe must, therefore, continue to strengthen our collaboration towards flood prevention and mitigation,\u201dObuah said.\nEarlier, acting Director-General, FEMD, Mr Mohammed Sabo, said that the flood risk assessment and awareness campaign was part of strategies to strengthen disaster risk reduction.\nSabo said that other flood prone communities would also be sensitized to mobilize residents to take proactive steps towards preventing loss of lives to flood.\nHe added that the flood risk assessment would enable FEMD to assess interventions that worked and areas that need additional interventions to prevent flooding.\nAlso, Mr Florence Wenegieme, Director, Forecasting, Response and Mitigation, said that the bridge had taken many lives over the years during the rainy season.\nWenegiene explained that the people were killed by the flood because they tried to cross the flooded bridge against warnings by FEMD and local divers stationed at the bridge.\nMr Christopher Maikalangu, Chairman, Abuja Municipal Area Council, thanked Wike for the prompt intervention to prevent more people from dying from flooding along the bridge.\nHe said that the distance from the community to Ring Road II was 800 metres, but the residents had to travel five to six kilometres through alternative routes to get to the ring road.\nThe leader of the community, Mr Irimiya Kanpani, who could not hide his excitement over the minister\u2019s approval for the recommendation of the collapsed bridge described it as a huge relief,\n\u201cNow I can go to sleep knowing that the minister will fulfil his promise and my people will be safe. All I can say is thank you,\u201dhe said.",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

The women are suffering from infections and we\u2019re desperate.\u201d\nThe South Kivu provincial government, through its spokesman, acknowledged the consequences of the rising water levels at the border.\n\u201cThere were pillars already built that were submerged every time the water rose and blocked the work.\nA bridge is under construction to allow regular crossings. What has been done at Kamvinvira can also be done at Sange, so we\u2019re not standing still and are always looking for solutions. As long as the government is present, solutions will always be found.\u201d\nAs the provincial government seeks a solution to this problem, the Kamvinvira border remains the main access route to Bujumbura for many travellers, as Burundi has closed its other borders with Rwanda.\nAfricanews/Hauwa M.",

        "Full_Content": "The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assured the people of Edo State that the state governorship election slated for September 21 will go ahead despite the damage to the commission\u2019s office in the state.\nThe commission\u2019s state office in Benin, Edo state capital was recently submerged in water when heavy downpour flooded the office destroying vital election hardware, machines such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation Machines (BVAS), documents and other materials.\nProf. Yakubu, while on an inspection visit to Benin to assess the level and impact of destruction at the state\u2019s INEC office said all facilities damaged by the flood will be replaced ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\u201cWe are here to see for ourselves what happened to our facilities following the unexpected torrential rainfall and flooding. We thank God that no life was lost, and no injuries sustained. But we want to assure you that despite the extensive damage, we will recover to conduct the governorship election in September\u201d.\nProf Yakubu said the commission would salvage some equipment from neighboring states to replace any shortfall and ensure the successful conduct of the election.\nHe assured Edo people that the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CVR, would continue despite the setback while promising to be more strategic in dealing with flood going forward.\nYakubu, ordered the deployment of more voter registration machines to some of the registration centres in Edo state for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and commended the mass turnout of prospective registrants at different centres in the state.\nHe assured that INEC would do everything possible to make the process seamless.\nAt the Western Boys Secondary School, Ward 2, Ikpoba Okha LGA, registration centre, Yakubu directed that two additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation Systems, BVAS, machines be mobilized to cater for the large number of registrants.\n\u201cThe most important thing is for us to expedite the process. So what we have decided now is that tomorrow there will be two additional machines to this centre, to make it five machines.\n\u201cThere are two queues. One is for registration, the other one is for transfer and collection of cards. So they are going to reorganise the queues. But I have seen the numbers here, and one of the solutions is to increase the number of machines to this centre,\u201dhe said.\nProf. Yakubu directed that additional registration machines be deployed to the INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office centre. He also monitored the exercise at Eweka Primary School in Use Ward 3, Egor LGA.\nThe INEC Chairman, however, warned the staff of the commission against falling prey to any form of inducement before registering prospective voters during the exercise.\nOn complaints that some political parties were trying to hijack the exercises in the favour of their supporters, Yakubu said that the commission would be meeting with the state commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to address the concern.\n\u201cMy message consistently is that all the staff engaged in the registration, whether they are ad hoc staff or regular staff, should know that no one should collect money from any Nigerian who comes to register or transfer or request for replacement of cards.\n\u201cThis is a service paid for by the federal government of Nigeria and it must be respected. Where we catch any staff involved in this act, that staff will be dealt with, whether the staff is regular staff or ad hoc staff,\u201dYakubu said.\nEarlier, some of the prospective registrants in the queue who commended INEC for the exercise urged the commission to mobilize more registration machines to fast-track the registration process.\nMrs. Sliver Angela and Mr Oluwasegun Oketoki at the registration centre located at INEC Ikpoba Okha LGA Office, who said they came out as early as 5 am to register, called for the deployment of more machines to the centre to speed up the registration process.\n\u201cMost of us came here since 5.30. The machine was not working fast.\n\u201cThe INEC staff are trying to coordinate us but some of us are pushing to boycott the line. That is what is delaying us. Now they are attending to us and everything is going on smoothly.\n\u201cIf there is any alternative to bringing additional machines, let INEC do so,\u201dAngela said.\nMrs Blessings Uwagwe at Eweka Primary School, also complained about the delay in the process and the need for more machines to be deployed as more people are coming out to register.\nMr Oransaiye Nicolas said initially one machine was deployed to the centre, but following their complaints, an additional two machines were mobilised to the centre.\nNicolas commended the new directive by Prof. Mahmood Yakubu that additional machines be deployed to the centre, saying it will quicken the process.\nMeanwhile, an INEC ad hoc Staff, Mr Oladele Emmanuel, an NYSC corps member deployed for the registration exercise at the centre said no challenge with the functionality of the registration machines.\nThe Edo State Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC, Anugbum Onuoha, commended the commission\u2019s proactive response to the flood and pledged commitment to a credible and successful election.\nProf. Mahmood Yakubu was accompanied on the inspection visit by national commissioners Abubakar Sam Olumekun, May Agbamuche-Mba and Rhoda Gumus.\nEmmanuel Ukoh",

        "Title": "LGAs In Anambra State Under High Flood Risk \u2013 NEMA DG",
        "Full_Content": "The Director General National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Zubaida Umar, has disclosed that 11 Local Government Areas in Anambra State: Ogbaru, Anambra East, Anambra West, Ayamelum, Idemili North, Onitsha North, Nnewi North, Idemili South, Onitsha South, Ihiala and Ekwusigo are under high and moderate flood risk, and these are already listed in the earlier NEMA communication to the Government of Anambra State.\nThe NEMA DG stated this in Awka, the state capital on Wednesday, during 2024 downscaling of flood early warning strategies for early actions to save lives and livelihoods during the rainy season in Anambra State.\nAccording to the NEMA Boss, \u201cThe devastating impacts of flood over the years especially that of 2012 and 2022 have served as a wakeup call to all tiers of Governments and their line Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) to collaborate with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to manage disaster risks and associated hazards. In the recent past, lives have been lost, means of livelihood and infrastructure amounting to billions of Naira have been destroyed by floods. Our citizens have equally suffered injuries and lost their life savings due to unmitigated incidences of floods and secondary hazards.\nFrom North to South and East to West, straddling vast swathes of land, river banks, coastal areas, built up environment, farmlands, economic and industrial centers, floods have continually impacted negatively on Nigerian citizens. The rainfall and flood advisories contained in the Seasonal Climate Prediction (SCP) and Annual Flood Outlook (AFO) of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) respectively, have provided us valuable early warning alerts. Consequently, all of us are expected to take actions that will drastically reduce the adverse impacts of floods on the entire landscape and the Nigerian population, with emphasis to the most vulnerable persons living in communities identified to be at risk of inundation during the year.\nUmar, further stated that NIHSA has specifically stated that in 2024 148 LGAs in 31 States are predicted to be within the high flood risk areas while 249 LGAs in 35 States including FCT are considered to fall within the moderate flood risk areas.She added that the remaining 377 LGAs are forecasted for the low flood risk areas and these flood risk areas are presented with their degree of vulnerability to serve as a tool for governments at all levels to develop risk reduction measures to avert disaster losses during the rainy season.\nShe called on public and private institutions, humanitarian and non-governmental organizations to leverage on these early warnings to support the efforts of government institutions. Umar also urged sectors of agriculture and food security, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), education, health, transportation, protection and security, to set up mechanisms for disaster preparedness and risk reduction based on the early action strategies.\n\u201cIt is in this regard that the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) convened a two-day Experts Technical Meeting of relevant stakeholders in April, 2024 to review the NIMET SCP and the NIHSA AFO to develop early warning and mitigation strategies for Nigeria. An Emergency Coordination Forum (ECF) was also convened on the 7th of May in Abuja to analyze the disaster risk management implications of the SCP and AFO predictions. These events were to design and incorporate direct risk communication and engagement approaches to disseminate early warning messages for early actions at state, local government and community levels. This underscores the rationale for carrying out the sensitization exercises across the country as we flag off this event in Awka, Anambra State today.\n\u201cAs reflected in NEMA\u2019s flood incidence dashboard, Anambra State has in the past suffered severe flooding in terms of spatial coverage, severe losses and damage as well as fatalities. While sympathizing with the Government and good people of Anambra State over the unprecedented adverse effects of flood risks is the past years.\n\u201cAccordingly, I call on the State and Local Governments, Traditional institutions, faith based organizations, public and private institutions and relevant stakeholders to support NEMA in this initiative of downscaling flood early warning and mitigation messages to the grassroots. I want to use this opportunity to call on our revered traditional rulers, the clergy, opinion leaders, women and youth groups and the media in Anambra State to support proactive measures that will avert the negative impacts of the floods during the 2024 rainy season.\n\u201cI find it necessary to stress that management of disaster risk in contemporary times is hinged on community participation, leaving no one behind. As we always emphasize at NEMA, \u2018\u2018disaster management is everyone\u2019s business\u2019\u2019.\nWe must work together to safeguard communities at risk, protect critical infrastructure and support uninterrupted socio-economic activities in Anambra State. It is not by accident that NEMA selected Anambra State, the Light of the nation for this event. It is in recognition of the status of Anambra State as a focal point for exchange of goods and services and positive ideas that will permeate the entire South East region, Nigeria and beyond.\n\u201cI urge you to accord this event the very serious attention it deserves in consideration of the identified vulnerability of the populations especially in those Local Government Areas and communities at risk of flooding during the year. It is my hope that today\u2019s event will go a long way in reducing the impacts of the annually recurring floods and to safeguard the private and communal and livelihoods of the good people of Anambra State. This is the guaranteed path of driving socio economic growth and development in line with the renewed hope agenda of the Federal Government under the stewardship of His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed, Tinubu, GCFR.\u201d\nThe NEMA DG commended Governor Soludo for all the measures put in place by the State Government to reduce the occurrence of those avoidable losses in the State.\nOn his part, the Governor of Anambra State, Professor Soludo, who spoke through his Deputy, Dr Onyekachukwu Ibezim described the sensitization as apt as Anambra has continued to experience flood disaster each year causing it various degrees of loss, assuring that the government will collaborate NEMA and the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to ensure that people in prone areas in the state are well enlightened to avoid casualties and preventable damages.\nThe Governor who appreciated the federal government for always coming to the aid of the state during flooding, pleaded for more assistance in the aspect of bringing permanent solution to flooding through construction of dams and other necessary interventions.\nThe Executive Secretary, SEMA, Paul Odenigbo, said,\u201cThe Anambra State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, in collaboration with its federal counterpart, NEMA, and other relevant partners such as International Organisation on Migration, IOM, the Nigerian Red Cross, Civil Society Organisations and the Ministries of Health, Environment and Utilities have continued to engage in serious public awareness campaigns, to enlighten and sensitize stakeholders of the flood prone communities on the coming heavy downpour and its consequential flooding.\u201d\nUmar gave the assurance during her visit to Governor Chukwuma Soludo at the government house.\nMeanwhile, speaking earlier during her visit to Governor Soludo at the government house, the NEMA DG, called for the set up of Local Emergency Management Committees, LEMCs, in every Local Government Area with predictable funding to manage disasters together with traditional institutions and community volunteers, even as she galvanized support for persons affected by disasters before the arrival of external assistance.",

        "Full_Content": "The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has commenced building emergency shelters across the nine Niger Delta states to aid flood victims.\nThe states are Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers.\nDr Samual Ogbuku, the Managing Director of NDDC, disclosed this at a one-day workshop in Port Harcourt on Tuesday, focusing on implementing a regional flood disaster emergency response strategy.\nHe said that the Niger Delta was faced with an existential threat due to climate change, which could potentially devastate the region and have an enormous social-economic impact.\n\u201cHence, the commission is currently building multi-purpose emergency shelters across the Niger Delta to provide assistance to flood victims.\n\u201cThese emergency shelters, designed to accommodate over 1,000 people, will serve as a temporary refuge during flood emergencies,\u201dhe said.\nOgbuku disclosed that the facility in each of the states would be equipped with essential amenities such as school, hospital, cafeteria, police post, and recreation centre.\n\u201cWhen completed, these emergency shelters will provide temporary accommodation and necessary services to communities during emergencies.\n\u201cWe realized that displaced people often seek refuge in school buildings during floods, forcing schools to suspend academic activities at great cost,\u201dhe stressed.\nThe managing director said that the workshop, focused on enhancing resilience in mitigating flood disasters in the region, underscored NDDC\u2019s commitment to addressing the challenge.\nAccording to him, the flood mitigation was crucial, given the region\u2019s topography and proximity to water bodies that made it susceptible to frequent flooding.\n\u201cCoastal and riverine communities, situated in low-lying areas, are at significant risk, with data showing over 100 fatalities between January 2021 and April 2023 due to flooding.\n\u201cAs we approach the peak of the rainy season, urgent measures are necessary to minimize flood impact, with collaboration among organisations and communities essential in this effort,\u201dhe said.\nOgbuku urged for partnership with the local communities, state governments, non-governmental organisations and international partners to tackle the disaster.\nMr Onuoha Obeka, Director of Environmental Control and Protection at NDDC, said that the workshop served as a platform for sharing knowledge, understanding best practices and adopting innovative strategies.\nHe emphasized that the adoption of innovative strategies would strengthen emergency response mechanisms for sustainable recovery post-flood disasters.\n\u201cInstalling water level gauges and sensors strategically around river systems will provide early flood warning.\n\u201cThese early warning will facilitate the timely evacuation of people before considerable havoc is done,\u201dhe said.\nOn his part, Prof. Andrew Obafemi, former National President of the Nigeria Cartographic Association, stressed the importance of sharing information and data to reduce flooding effects.\nHe recommenced the Niger Delta Environmental Survey plan as a crucial project to develop a reliable data bank for addressing flooding in the NDDC states.\nNAN / Foluke Ibitomi",

        "Full_Content": "Riots erupted in Algerian desert city last weekend after months of water shortages left taps running dry and forced residents to queue to access water for their households.\nIn Tiaret, a central Algerian city of less than 200,000 located 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Algiers protestors wearing balaclavas set tires aflame and set up make-shift barricades blocking roads to protest their water being rationed, according to pictures and videos circulating on social media.\nThe unrest followed demands from President bdelmajid Tebboune to rectify the suffering. At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state. Press freedom in the country has increasingly been curtailed and in recent years journalists have been imprisoned.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

Maize meal is Zambia\u2019s staple food.\n\u201cWith a heavy heart, on behalf of our government and the people of Zambia, we hereby appeal to the international community, our partners within the country, the private sector, the church and civil society organisations, to support our plan financially and materially, in mitigating the devastating effects of the drought,\u201d the president said.\nBesides the current food insecurity, Zambia has implemented eight-hour long electricity rationing periods to conserve power as most of the country\u2019s energy is from hydro sources.\nBBC/Jide Johnson.",

        "Full_Content": "Delicately and with intense concentration, Zanyiwe Ncube poured her small share of precious golden cooking oil into a plastic bottle at a food aid distribution site deep in rural Zimbabwe.\nHer relief at the handout paid for by the U.S. government as her southern African country deals with a severe drought was tempered when aid workers gently broke the news that this would be their last visit.\nNcube and her 7-month-old son she carried on her back were among 2,000 people who received rations of cooking oil, sorghum, peas and other supplies in the Mangwe district in southwestern Zimbabwe.\nThe food distribution is part of a programme funded by American aid agency USAID and rolled out by the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme.\nThey\u2019re aiming to help some of the 2.7 million people in rural Zimbabwe threatened with hunger because of the drought that has enveloped large parts of southern Africa since late last year.\nIt has scorched the crops that tens of millions of people grow themselves and rely on to survive, helped by what should be the rainy season.\nThey can rely on their crops and the weather less and less.\nThe drought in Zimbabwe, neighbouring Zambia and Malawi has reached crisis levels.\nZambia and Malawi have declared national disasters. Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell. The driest February in Zimbabwe in her lifetime, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s seasonal monitor, put an end to that.\n\u201cWe have nothing in the fields, not a single grain. Everything has dried up,\u201d she said.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says there are \u201coverlapping crises\u201d of extreme weather in eastern and southern Africa, with both regions lurching between storms and floods and heat and drought in the last year.\nIn southern Africa, an estimated 9 million people, half of them children, need help in Malawi.\nMore than 6 million in Zambia, 3 million of them children, are impacted by the drought, UNICEF said. That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "Morocco, where agriculture is a crucial sector, is heading for its sixth consecutive year of drought due to a drop in rainfall in recent months linked to climate change, Morocco\u2019s Minister of Equipment and Water, Nizar Baraka, said.\n\u201cWe have entered a critical phase after five consecutive years of drought that our country has never experienced before,\u201dsaid Mr Baraka at a press conference.\nRainfall has fallen by 67% in recent months compared with a year considered normal, and\u201cthe last three months (from October to December) show that we are heading for another year of drought\u201d,the minister added.\nIn Morocco, agriculture employs a third of the working-age population and accounts for 14% of the country\u2019s exports.\nWater stress in Morocco has been exacerbated by rising temperatures, which have increased water evaporation from dams.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture predicts an average temperature rise of 1.3 degrees Celsius by 2050.\nThe North African country\u2019s reservoirs are currently only 23.5% full, compared with 31% at the same time last year, which is\u201ca very dangerous situation\u201d,said Mr Baraka.\n\u201cOur hopes are high for the next three months, which are (usually) the rainiest in our country\u201d,he added.\nFailing that, local authorities in some regions will have to turn off the water supply, usually at night.\nIn the face of growing water stress, the authorities are betting on seawater desalination projects, such as the one due to start construction next month in Casablanca, the country\u2019s largest conurbation with over six million inhabitants.\nBy the end of 2027, Morocco plans to build seven desalination plants with a total capacity of 143 million cubic meters per year.\nThere are currently 12 desalination plants in the country, with a total capacity of 179.3 million cubic meters per year, according to official data.\nAfricanews/Hauwa M.",

        "Full_Content": "US first lady Jill Biden got an up-close look Sunday at thehistoric East Africa droughtas she walked along arid land and listened as some Maasai women described how their children and livestock are going hungry.\nShe appealed for more countriesto join the United Statesto help alleviate the suffering.\nSome areas of theHorn of Africahave endured five consecutive failed rainy seasons, meaning there was no rainfall or an insufficient amount to help farmers with their crops and livestock.\nAn upcoming sixth rainy season, beginning in March, is expected to be about the same or worse.\nBiden, who was on the final day of a five-day visit to Africa, toured an outreach center in the town operated by World Vision with support from UNICEF and the World Food Program.\nShe chatted with people who had brought their children to be screened for malnutrition and she participated in a discussion with a group of women, including a mother of 10 children, who shared their stories.\n\u201cThey talked about how their livestock are dying. Obviously, you can see the drought here, how bad it is,\u201dthe first lady told reporters afterward.\u201cThe one source of water here feeds 12 villages and each village has approximately a thousand to 1,200 people.\u201d\n\u201cSo they are coming here, the people are coming to get water, they\u2019re bringing their livestock to get water. But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture. We hope the long rains will be enough,\u201dhe said.\nBiden sought to use her stature to help focus the world\u2019s attention on the worsening humanitarian crisis in East Africa by touring the drought-stricken area near Kenya\u2019s border with Tanzania.\nOn the nearly three-hour drive south of Nairobi, the capital, Biden\u2019s lengthy motorcade passed over dry river and creek beds.\nThrongs of people lined both sides of the motorcade route at various points, waving or using their cell phones to record the event.\nSome 4.4 million people in Kenya are facing high levels of food insecurity, with the number projected to rise to 5.4 million in March, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nAlready, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families\u2019 health and livelihood have died.\nMany of the people affected are farmers who have watched their crops wither and die, and their water sources run dry.\nNorthern Kenya, which is arid and semi-arid and is where pastoralist communities live, is most affected.\nThe country\u2019s agriculture sector heavily relies on rainfall, and the meteorological department is predicting delayed rains in the upcoming short rainy season that should begin in March.\nPresident William Ruto announced last October that his cabinet had lifted a decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops.\nThe decision came amid pressure from the U.S. government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.\nLast week, Ruto led the country in praying for rain.\nThe first lady has been highlighting the drought along with women and youth empowerment since arriving in Namibia last Wednesday.\nBiden had visited Kenya in 2011, when her husband, Joe Biden, was serving as vice president, to help raise awareness about what then was considered a severe famine.\nUS officials and aid organizations say the current drought is far worse.\nAbout halfway through drive to Lositeti, the first lady traded her black SUV for a smaller one more suited for the rugged terrain ahead.\nThe village was the final stop on a five-day, two-country visit that took her from Namibia, along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, to Kenya in the east.\nIt was her sixth visit overall to Africa, and her first as first lady, she travelled with her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, who is 29.\nBiden met throughout the week with young people, women and entrepreneurs as she promoted U.S., backed programs that teach about HIV/AIDS, preventing infection and safe sex practices.\nOther programs she visited help people learn skills to find jobs or start businesses to support their families.\nAlong the way, she said a comments that the strongest indication yet that her husband will seek to be re-elected in 2024.\nAsked if the only thing left to do was to decide on when and where to announce the campaign, she replied,\u201cPretty much.\u201d\nThe president, who later was asked about his wife\u2019s comments, offered a more measured response, saying he had\u201cother things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.\u201d\nyahoo news",

        "Full_Content": "Riots erupted in Algerian desert city last weekend after months of water shortages left taps running dry and forced residents to queue to access water for their households.\nIn Tiaret, a central Algerian city of less than 200,000 located 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Algiers protestors wearing balaclavas set tires aflame and set up make-shift barricades blocking roads to protest their water being rationed, according to pictures and videos circulating on social media.\nThe unrest followed demands from President bdelmajid Tebboune to rectify the suffering. At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state. Press freedom in the country has increasingly been curtailed and in recent years journalists have been imprisoned.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

        "Full_Content": "Delicately and with intense concentration, Zanyiwe Ncube poured her small share of precious golden cooking oil into a plastic bottle at a food aid distribution site deep in rural Zimbabwe.\nHer relief at the handout paid for by the U.S. government as her southern African country deals with a severe drought was tempered when aid workers gently broke the news that this would be their last visit.\nNcube and her 7-month-old son she carried on her back were among 2,000 people who received rations of cooking oil, sorghum, peas and other supplies in the Mangwe district in southwestern Zimbabwe.\nThe food distribution is part of a programme funded by American aid agency USAID and rolled out by the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme.\nThey\u2019re aiming to help some of the 2.7 million people in rural Zimbabwe threatened with hunger because of the drought that has enveloped large parts of southern Africa since late last year.\nIt has scorched the crops that tens of millions of people grow themselves and rely on to survive, helped by what should be the rainy season.\nThey can rely on their crops and the weather less and less.\nThe drought in Zimbabwe, neighbouring Zambia and Malawi has reached crisis levels.\nZambia and Malawi have declared national disasters. Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell. The driest February in Zimbabwe in her lifetime, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s seasonal monitor, put an end to that.\n\u201cWe have nothing in the fields, not a single grain. Everything has dried up,\u201d she said.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says there are \u201coverlapping crises\u201d of extreme weather in eastern and southern Africa, with both regions lurching between storms and floods and heat and drought in the last year.\nIn southern Africa, an estimated 9 million people, half of them children, need help in Malawi.\nMore than 6 million in Zambia, 3 million of them children, are impacted by the drought, UNICEF said. That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

        "Full_Content": "Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema declared the drought a national disaster and emergency on Thursday, saying it had devastated food production and power generation, as the country struggles to recover a recent cholera epidemic.\nLike some of its neighbors, this southern African country is suffering from severe drought due to the El Nino phenomenon, which is worsening harsh weather conditions attributed in part to climate change.In a statement to the nation, Hichilema said he had asked security forces to focus more on food production. He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "Six consecutive years of drought have left Moroccan dams at critical levels, prompting a big drop in the area of land being irrigated, Morocco\u2019s water and agriculture ministers said.\nBy mid-January, Morocco\u2019s average dam filling rate had dropped to 23.2% from 31.5% a year earlier, water minister Nizar Baraka told a meeting on Tuesday, according to a royal palace statement.Rainfall was 70% lower than in an average year, he said.The country\u2019s second biggest dam, Al Masira, which serves the economic hub of Casablanca, is almost empty.The worst drought In more than two decades prompted authorities to ban the use of drinking water to clean streets or irrigate parks in cities and to stop dam water being used to irrigate some key farming areas.The decision took many farmers by surprise in the area of Taroudant in the Souss region, the main source of Morocco\u2019s fresh produce, which supplies supermarkets across Europe and is a major source of export revenue.\u201cStopping dam irrigation has sapped my investments \u2026 this year\u2019s production is in danger,\u201d Mbark N\u2019Ait Ali, a banana and vegetable farmer in Taroudant, said.Wells have dried up in the area, with farmers having to dig down to 400 meters with no guarantee of finding enough water, he added.This \u201cviolent drought\u201d had forced a reduction in the dam-irrigated area to 400,000 hectares from 750,000 hectares before the dry spell, agriculture minister Sadiki added.\u201cAutumn crops are at a critical condition \u2026 we pray for rain,\u201d he said.The ploughed area with rain-fed cereals has dropped this year to 2.3 million hectares, from 3.65 million hectares last year, which was also a dry year, he said.Morocco\u2019s statistics agency expects the cereals harvest to be less than average this year, meaning more wheat imports.As well as building waterways and new dams, Morocco plans eight new desalination plants powered by renewables.It aims to produce 1.3 billion cubic metres of fresh water from desalination by 2035.\u201cWe are afraid it will be too late when desalination will be ready to irrigate our farms,\u201d said N\u2019Ait Ali.\nReuters /Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "US first lady Jill Biden got an up-close look Sunday at thehistoric East Africa droughtas she walked along arid land and listened as some Maasai women described how their children and livestock are going hungry.\nShe appealed for more countriesto join the United Statesto help alleviate the suffering.\nSome areas of theHorn of Africahave endured five consecutive failed rainy seasons, meaning there was no rainfall or an insufficient amount to help farmers with their crops and livestock.\nAn upcoming sixth rainy season, beginning in March, is expected to be about the same or worse.\nBiden, who was on the final day of a five-day visit to Africa, toured an outreach center in the town operated by World Vision with support from UNICEF and the World Food Program.\nShe chatted with people who had brought their children to be screened for malnutrition and she participated in a discussion with a group of women, including a mother of 10 children, who shared their stories.\n\u201cThey talked about how their livestock are dying. Obviously, you can see the drought here, how bad it is,\u201dthe first lady told reporters afterward.\u201cThe one source of water here feeds 12 villages and each village has approximately a thousand to 1,200 people.\u201d\n\u201cSo they are coming here, the people are coming to get water, they\u2019re bringing their livestock to get water. But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture. We hope the long rains will be enough,\u201dhe said.\nBiden sought to use her stature to help focus the world\u2019s attention on the worsening humanitarian crisis in East Africa by touring the drought-stricken area near Kenya\u2019s border with Tanzania.\nOn the nearly three-hour drive south of Nairobi, the capital, Biden\u2019s lengthy motorcade passed over dry river and creek beds.\nThrongs of people lined both sides of the motorcade route at various points, waving or using their cell phones to record the event.\nSome 4.4 million people in Kenya are facing high levels of food insecurity, with the number projected to rise to 5.4 million in March, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nAlready, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families\u2019 health and livelihood have died.\nMany of the people affected are farmers who have watched their crops wither and die, and their water sources run dry.\nNorthern Kenya, which is arid and semi-arid and is where pastoralist communities live, is most affected.\nThe country\u2019s agriculture sector heavily relies on rainfall, and the meteorological department is predicting delayed rains in the upcoming short rainy season that should begin in March.\nPresident William Ruto announced last October that his cabinet had lifted a decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops.\nThe decision came amid pressure from the U.S. government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.\nLast week, Ruto led the country in praying for rain.\nThe first lady has been highlighting the drought along with women and youth empowerment since arriving in Namibia last Wednesday.\nBiden had visited Kenya in 2011, when her husband, Joe Biden, was serving as vice president, to help raise awareness about what then was considered a severe famine.\nUS officials and aid organizations say the current drought is far worse.\nAbout halfway through drive to Lositeti, the first lady traded her black SUV for a smaller one more suited for the rugged terrain ahead.\nThe village was the final stop on a five-day, two-country visit that took her from Namibia, along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, to Kenya in the east.\nIt was her sixth visit overall to Africa, and her first as first lady, she travelled with her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, who is 29.\nBiden met throughout the week with young people, women and entrepreneurs as she promoted U.S., backed programs that teach about HIV/AIDS, preventing infection and safe sex practices.\nOther programs she visited help people learn skills to find jobs or start businesses to support their families.\nAlong the way, she said a comments that the strongest indication yet that her husband will seek to be re-elected in 2024.\nAsked if the only thing left to do was to decide on when and where to announce the campaign, she replied,\u201cPretty much.\u201d\nThe president, who later was asked about his wife\u2019s comments, offered a more measured response, saying he had\u201cother things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.\u201d\nyahoo news",

At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state.

Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell. The driest February in Zimbabwe in her lifetime, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s seasonal monitor, put an end to that.\n\u201cWe have nothing in the fields, not a single grain. Everything has dried up,\u201d she said.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says there are \u201coverlapping crises\u201d of extreme weather in eastern and southern Africa, with both regions lurching between storms and floods and heat and drought in the last year.\nIn southern Africa, an estimated 9 million people, half of them children, need help in Malawi.\nMore than 6 million in Zambia, 3 million of them children, are impacted by the drought, UNICEF said. That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

For Neno, it has been hit hard. So, the president\u2019s declaration means other people are going to come in now, lifting the hand of government where it wasn\u2019t necessarily able to do it.

        "Full_Content": "Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema declared the drought a national disaster and emergency on Thursday, saying it had devastated food production and power generation, as the country struggles to recover a recent cholera epidemic.\nLike some of its neighbors, this southern African country is suffering from severe drought due to the El Nino phenomenon, which is worsening harsh weather conditions attributed in part to climate change.In a statement to the nation, Hichilema said he had asked security forces to focus more on food production. He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "Six consecutive years of drought have left Moroccan dams at critical levels, prompting a big drop in the area of land being irrigated, Morocco\u2019s water and agriculture ministers said.\nBy mid-January, Morocco\u2019s average dam filling rate had dropped to 23.2% from 31.5% a year earlier, water minister Nizar Baraka told a meeting on Tuesday, according to a royal palace statement.Rainfall was 70% lower than in an average year, he said.The country\u2019s second biggest dam, Al Masira, which serves the economic hub of Casablanca, is almost empty.The worst drought In more than two decades prompted authorities to ban the use of drinking water to clean streets or irrigate parks in cities and to stop dam water being used to irrigate some key farming areas.The decision took many farmers by surprise in the area of Taroudant in the Souss region, the main source of Morocco\u2019s fresh produce, which supplies supermarkets across Europe and is a major source of export revenue.\u201cStopping dam irrigation has sapped my investments \u2026 this year\u2019s production is in danger,\u201d Mbark N\u2019Ait Ali, a banana and vegetable farmer in Taroudant, said.Wells have dried up in the area, with farmers having to dig down to 400 meters with no guarantee of finding enough water, he added.This \u201cviolent drought\u201d had forced a reduction in the dam-irrigated area to 400,000 hectares from 750,000 hectares before the dry spell, agriculture minister Sadiki added.\u201cAutumn crops are at a critical condition \u2026 we pray for rain,\u201d he said.The ploughed area with rain-fed cereals has dropped this year to 2.3 million hectares, from 3.65 million hectares last year, which was also a dry year, he said.Morocco\u2019s statistics agency expects the cereals harvest to be less than average this year, meaning more wheat imports.As well as building waterways and new dams, Morocco plans eight new desalination plants powered by renewables.It aims to produce 1.3 billion cubic metres of fresh water from desalination by 2035.\u201cWe are afraid it will be too late when desalination will be ready to irrigate our farms,\u201d said N\u2019Ait Ali.\nReuters /Patience Ameh",

Obviously, you can see the drought here, how bad it is,\u201dthe first lady told reporters afterward.\u201cThe one source of water here feeds 12 villages and each village has approximately a thousand to 1,200 people.\u201d\n\u201cSo they are coming here, the people are coming to get water, they\u2019re bringing their livestock to get water. But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture.

        "Full_Content": "Riots erupted in Algerian desert city last weekend after months of water shortages left taps running dry and forced residents to queue to access water for their households.\nIn Tiaret, a central Algerian city of less than 200,000 located 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Algiers protestors wearing balaclavas set tires aflame and set up make-shift barricades blocking roads to protest their water being rationed, according to pictures and videos circulating on social media.\nThe unrest followed demands from President bdelmajid Tebboune to rectify the suffering. At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state.

Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell.

That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture. We hope the long rains will be enough,\u201dhe said.\nBiden sought to use her stature to help focus the world\u2019s attention on the worsening humanitarian crisis in East Africa by touring the drought-stricken area near Kenya\u2019s border with Tanzania.\nOn the nearly three-hour drive south of Nairobi, the capital, Biden\u2019s lengthy motorcade passed over dry river and creek beds.\nThrongs of people lined both sides of the motorcade route at various points, waving or using their cell phones to record the event.\nSome 4.4 million people in Kenya are facing high levels of food insecurity, with the number projected to rise to 5.4 million in March, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nAlready, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families\u2019 health and livelihood have died.\nMany of the people affected are farmers who have watched their crops wither and die, and their water sources run dry.\nNorthern Kenya, which is arid and semi-arid and is where pastoralist communities live, is most affected.\nThe country\u2019s agriculture sector heavily relies on rainfall, and the meteorological department is predicting delayed rains in the upcoming short rainy season that should begin in March.\nPresident William Ruto announced last October that his cabinet had lifted a decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops.\nThe decision came amid pressure from the U.S. government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.\nLast week, Ruto led the country in praying for rain.\nThe first lady has been highlighting the drought along with women and youth empowerment since arriving in Namibia last Wednesday.\nBiden had visited Kenya in 2011, when her husband, Joe Biden, was serving as vice president, to help raise awareness about what then was considered a severe famine.\nUS officials and aid organizations say the current drought is far worse.\nAbout halfway through drive to Lositeti, the first lady traded her black SUV for a smaller one more suited for the rugged terrain ahead.\nThe village was the final stop on a five-day, two-country visit that took her from Namibia, along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, to Kenya in the east.\nIt was her sixth visit overall to Africa, and her first as first lady, she travelled with her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, who is 29.\nBiden met throughout the week with young people, women and entrepreneurs as she promoted U.S., backed programs that teach about HIV/AIDS, preventing infection and safe sex practices.\nOther programs she visited help people learn skills to find jobs or start businesses to support their families.\nAlong the way, she said a comments that the strongest indication yet that her husband will seek to be re-elected in 2024.\nAsked if the only thing left to do was to decide on when and where to announce the campaign, she replied,\u201cPretty much.\u201d\nThe president, who later was asked about his wife\u2019s comments, offered a more measured response, saying he had\u201cother things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.\u201d\nyahoo news",

        "Full_Content": "Riots erupted in Algerian desert city last weekend after months of water shortages left taps running dry and forced residents to queue to access water for their households.\nIn Tiaret, a central Algerian city of less than 200,000 located 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Algiers protestors wearing balaclavas set tires aflame and set up make-shift barricades blocking roads to protest their water being rationed, according to pictures and videos circulating on social media.\nThe unrest followed demands from President bdelmajid Tebboune to rectify the suffering. At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state. Press freedom in the country has increasingly been curtailed and in recent years journalists have been imprisoned.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell. The driest February in Zimbabwe in her lifetime, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s seasonal monitor, put an end to that.\n\u201cWe have nothing in the fields, not a single grain.

That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "Morocco, where agriculture is a crucial sector, is heading for its sixth consecutive year of drought due to a drop in rainfall in recent months linked to climate change, Morocco\u2019s Minister of Equipment and Water, Nizar Baraka, said.\n\u201cWe have entered a critical phase after five consecutive years of drought that our country has never experienced before,\u201dsaid Mr Baraka at a press conference.\nRainfall has fallen by 67% in recent months compared with a year considered normal, and\u201cthe last three months (from October to December) show that we are heading for another year of drought\u201d,the minister added.\nIn Morocco, agriculture employs a third of the working-age population and accounts for 14% of the country\u2019s exports.\nWater stress in Morocco has been exacerbated by rising temperatures, which have increased water evaporation from dams.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture predicts an average temperature rise of 1.3 degrees Celsius by 2050.\nThe North African country\u2019s reservoirs are currently only 23.5% full, compared with 31% at the same time last year, which is\u201ca very dangerous situation\u201d,said Mr Baraka.\n\u201cOur hopes are high for the next three months, which are (usually) the rainiest in our country\u201d,he added.\nFailing that, local authorities in some regions will have to turn off the water supply, usually at night.\nIn the face of growing water stress, the authorities are betting on seawater desalination projects, such as the one due to start construction next month in Casablanca, the country\u2019s largest conurbation with over six million inhabitants.\nBy the end of 2027, Morocco plans to build seven desalination plants with a total capacity of 143 million cubic meters per year.\nThere are currently 12 desalination plants in the country, with a total capacity of 179.3 million cubic meters per year, according to official data.\nAfricanews/Hauwa M.",

        "Full_Content": "US first lady Jill Biden got an up-close look Sunday at thehistoric East Africa droughtas she walked along arid land and listened as some Maasai women described how their children and livestock are going hungry.\nShe appealed for more countriesto join the United Statesto help alleviate the suffering.\nSome areas of theHorn of Africahave endured five consecutive failed rainy seasons, meaning there was no rainfall or an insufficient amount to help farmers with their crops and livestock.\nAn upcoming sixth rainy season, beginning in March, is expected to be about the same or worse.\nBiden, who was on the final day of a five-day visit to Africa, toured an outreach center in the town operated by World Vision with support from UNICEF and the World Food Program.\nShe chatted with people who had brought their children to be screened for malnutrition and she participated in a discussion with a group of women, including a mother of 10 children, who shared their stories.\n\u201cThey talked about how their livestock are dying. Obviously, you can see the drought here, how bad it is,\u201dthe first lady told reporters afterward.\u201cThe one source of water here feeds 12 villages and each village has approximately a thousand to 1,200 people.\u201d\n\u201cSo they are coming here, the people are coming to get water, they\u2019re bringing their livestock to get water. But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture. We hope the long rains will be enough,\u201dhe said.\nBiden sought to use her stature to help focus the world\u2019s attention on the worsening humanitarian crisis in East Africa by touring the drought-stricken area near Kenya\u2019s border with Tanzania.\nOn the nearly three-hour drive south of Nairobi, the capital, Biden\u2019s lengthy motorcade passed over dry river and creek beds.\nThrongs of people lined both sides of the motorcade route at various points, waving or using their cell phones to record the event.\nSome 4.4 million people in Kenya are facing high levels of food insecurity, with the number projected to rise to 5.4 million in March, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nAlready, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families\u2019 health and livelihood have died.\nMany of the people affected are farmers who have watched their crops wither and die, and their water sources run dry.\nNorthern Kenya, which is arid and semi-arid and is where pastoralist communities live, is most affected.\nThe country\u2019s agriculture sector heavily relies on rainfall, and the meteorological department is predicting delayed rains in the upcoming short rainy season that should begin in March.\nPresident William Ruto announced last October that his cabinet had lifted a decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops.\nThe decision came amid pressure from the U.S. government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.\nLast week, Ruto led the country in praying for rain.\nThe first lady has been highlighting the drought along with women and youth empowerment since arriving in Namibia last Wednesday.\nBiden had visited Kenya in 2011, when her husband, Joe Biden, was serving as vice president, to help raise awareness about what then was considered a severe famine.\nUS officials and aid organizations say the current drought is far worse.\nAbout halfway through drive to Lositeti, the first lady traded her black SUV for a smaller one more suited for the rugged terrain ahead.\nThe village was the final stop on a five-day, two-country visit that took her from Namibia, along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, to Kenya in the east.\nIt was her sixth visit overall to Africa, and her first as first lady, she travelled with her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, who is 29.\nBiden met throughout the week with young people, women and entrepreneurs as she promoted U.S., backed programs that teach about HIV/AIDS, preventing infection and safe sex practices.\nOther programs she visited help people learn skills to find jobs or start businesses to support their families.\nAlong the way, she said a comments that the strongest indication yet that her husband will seek to be re-elected in 2024.\nAsked if the only thing left to do was to decide on when and where to announce the campaign, she replied,\u201cPretty much.\u201d\nThe president, who later was asked about his wife\u2019s comments, offered a more measured response, saying he had\u201cother things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.\u201d\nyahoo news",

        "Full_Content": "Riots erupted in Algerian desert city last weekend after months of water shortages left taps running dry and forced residents to queue to access water for their households.\nIn Tiaret, a central Algerian city of less than 200,000 located 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Algiers protestors wearing balaclavas set tires aflame and set up make-shift barricades blocking roads to protest their water being rationed, according to pictures and videos circulating on social media.\nThe unrest followed demands from President bdelmajid Tebboune to rectify the suffering. At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state. Press freedom in the country has increasingly been curtailed and in recent years journalists have been imprisoned.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

        "Full_Content": "Delicately and with intense concentration, Zanyiwe Ncube poured her small share of precious golden cooking oil into a plastic bottle at a food aid distribution site deep in rural Zimbabwe.\nHer relief at the handout paid for by the U.S. government as her southern African country deals with a severe drought was tempered when aid workers gently broke the news that this would be their last visit.\nNcube and her 7-month-old son she carried on her back were among 2,000 people who received rations of cooking oil, sorghum, peas and other supplies in the Mangwe district in southwestern Zimbabwe.\nThe food distribution is part of a programme funded by American aid agency USAID and rolled out by the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme.\nThey\u2019re aiming to help some of the 2.7 million people in rural Zimbabwe threatened with hunger because of the drought that has enveloped large parts of southern Africa since late last year.\nIt has scorched the crops that tens of millions of people grow themselves and rely on to survive, helped by what should be the rainy season.\nThey can rely on their crops and the weather less and less.\nThe drought in Zimbabwe, neighbouring Zambia and Malawi has reached crisis levels.\nZambia and Malawi have declared national disasters. Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell. The driest February in Zimbabwe in her lifetime, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s seasonal monitor, put an end to that.\n\u201cWe have nothing in the fields, not a single grain. Everything has dried up,\u201d she said.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says there are \u201coverlapping crises\u201d of extreme weather in eastern and southern Africa, with both regions lurching between storms and floods and heat and drought in the last year.\nIn southern Africa, an estimated 9 million people, half of them children, need help in Malawi.\nMore than 6 million in Zambia, 3 million of them children, are impacted by the drought, UNICEF said. That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

        "Full_Content": "Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema declared the drought a national disaster and emergency on Thursday, saying it had devastated food production and power generation, as the country struggles to recover a recent cholera epidemic.\nLike some of its neighbors, this southern African country is suffering from severe drought due to the El Nino phenomenon, which is worsening harsh weather conditions attributed in part to climate change.In a statement to the nation, Hichilema said he had asked security forces to focus more on food production. He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "Six consecutive years of drought have left Moroccan dams at critical levels, prompting a big drop in the area of land being irrigated, Morocco\u2019s water and agriculture ministers said.\nBy mid-January, Morocco\u2019s average dam filling rate had dropped to 23.2% from 31.5% a year earlier, water minister Nizar Baraka told a meeting on Tuesday, according to a royal palace statement.Rainfall was 70% lower than in an average year, he said.The country\u2019s second biggest dam, Al Masira, which serves the economic hub of Casablanca, is almost empty.The worst drought In more than two decades prompted authorities to ban the use of drinking water to clean streets or irrigate parks in cities and to stop dam water being used to irrigate some key farming areas.The decision took many farmers by surprise in the area of Taroudant in the Souss region, the main source of Morocco\u2019s fresh produce, which supplies supermarkets across Europe and is a major source of export revenue.\u201cStopping dam irrigation has sapped my investments \u2026 this year\u2019s production is in danger,\u201d Mbark N\u2019Ait Ali, a banana and vegetable farmer in Taroudant, said.Wells have dried up in the area, with farmers having to dig down to 400 meters with no guarantee of finding enough water, he added.This \u201cviolent drought\u201d had forced a reduction in the dam-irrigated area to 400,000 hectares from 750,000 hectares before the dry spell, agriculture minister Sadiki added.\u201cAutumn crops are at a critical condition \u2026 we pray for rain,\u201d he said.The ploughed area with rain-fed cereals has dropped this year to 2.3 million hectares, from 3.65 million hectares last year, which was also a dry year, he said.Morocco\u2019s statistics agency expects the cereals harvest to be less than average this year, meaning more wheat imports.As well as building waterways and new dams, Morocco plans eight new desalination plants powered by renewables.It aims to produce 1.3 billion cubic metres of fresh water from desalination by 2035.\u201cWe are afraid it will be too late when desalination will be ready to irrigate our farms,\u201d said N\u2019Ait Ali.\nReuters /Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "US first lady Jill Biden got an up-close look Sunday at thehistoric East Africa droughtas she walked along arid land and listened as some Maasai women described how their children and livestock are going hungry.\nShe appealed for more countriesto join the United Statesto help alleviate the suffering.\nSome areas of theHorn of Africahave endured five consecutive failed rainy seasons, meaning there was no rainfall or an insufficient amount to help farmers with their crops and livestock.\nAn upcoming sixth rainy season, beginning in March, is expected to be about the same or worse.\nBiden, who was on the final day of a five-day visit to Africa, toured an outreach center in the town operated by World Vision with support from UNICEF and the World Food Program.\nShe chatted with people who had brought their children to be screened for malnutrition and she participated in a discussion with a group of women, including a mother of 10 children, who shared their stories.\n\u201cThey talked about how their livestock are dying. Obviously, you can see the drought here, how bad it is,\u201dthe first lady told reporters afterward.\u201cThe one source of water here feeds 12 villages and each village has approximately a thousand to 1,200 people.\u201d\n\u201cSo they are coming here, the people are coming to get water, they\u2019re bringing their livestock to get water. But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture. We hope the long rains will be enough,\u201dhe said.\nBiden sought to use her stature to help focus the world\u2019s attention on the worsening humanitarian crisis in East Africa by touring the drought-stricken area near Kenya\u2019s border with Tanzania.\nOn the nearly three-hour drive south of Nairobi, the capital, Biden\u2019s lengthy motorcade passed over dry river and creek beds.\nThrongs of people lined both sides of the motorcade route at various points, waving or using their cell phones to record the event.\nSome 4.4 million people in Kenya are facing high levels of food insecurity, with the number projected to rise to 5.4 million in March, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nAlready, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families\u2019 health and livelihood have died.\nMany of the people affected are farmers who have watched their crops wither and die, and their water sources run dry.\nNorthern Kenya, which is arid and semi-arid and is where pastoralist communities live, is most affected.\nThe country\u2019s agriculture sector heavily relies on rainfall, and the meteorological department is predicting delayed rains in the upcoming short rainy season that should begin in March.\nPresident William Ruto announced last October that his cabinet had lifted a decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops.\nThe decision came amid pressure from the U.S. government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.\nLast week, Ruto led the country in praying for rain.\nThe first lady has been highlighting the drought along with women and youth empowerment since arriving in Namibia last Wednesday.\nBiden had visited Kenya in 2011, when her husband, Joe Biden, was serving as vice president, to help raise awareness about what then was considered a severe famine.\nUS officials and aid organizations say the current drought is far worse.\nAbout halfway through drive to Lositeti, the first lady traded her black SUV for a smaller one more suited for the rugged terrain ahead.\nThe village was the final stop on a five-day, two-country visit that took her from Namibia, along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, to Kenya in the east.\nIt was her sixth visit overall to Africa, and her first as first lady, she travelled with her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, who is 29.\nBiden met throughout the week with young people, women and entrepreneurs as she promoted U.S., backed programs that teach about HIV/AIDS, preventing infection and safe sex practices.\nOther programs she visited help people learn skills to find jobs or start businesses to support their families.\nAlong the way, she said a comments that the strongest indication yet that her husband will seek to be re-elected in 2024.\nAsked if the only thing left to do was to decide on when and where to announce the campaign, she replied,\u201cPretty much.\u201d\nThe president, who later was asked about his wife\u2019s comments, offered a more measured response, saying he had\u201cother things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.\u201d\nyahoo news",

At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state.

Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell. The driest February in Zimbabwe in her lifetime, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s seasonal monitor, put an end to that.\n\u201cWe have nothing in the fields, not a single grain. Everything has dried up,\u201d she said.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says there are \u201coverlapping crises\u201d of extreme weather in eastern and southern Africa, with both regions lurching between storms and floods and heat and drought in the last year.\nIn southern Africa, an estimated 9 million people, half of them children, need help in Malawi.\nMore than 6 million in Zambia, 3 million of them children, are impacted by the drought, UNICEF said. That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

For Neno, it has been hit hard. So, the president\u2019s declaration means other people are going to come in now, lifting the hand of government where it wasn\u2019t necessarily able to do it.

        "Full_Content": "Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema declared the drought a national disaster and emergency on Thursday, saying it had devastated food production and power generation, as the country struggles to recover a recent cholera epidemic.\nLike some of its neighbors, this southern African country is suffering from severe drought due to the El Nino phenomenon, which is worsening harsh weather conditions attributed in part to climate change.In a statement to the nation, Hichilema said he had asked security forces to focus more on food production. He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "Six consecutive years of drought have left Moroccan dams at critical levels, prompting a big drop in the area of land being irrigated, Morocco\u2019s water and agriculture ministers said.\nBy mid-January, Morocco\u2019s average dam filling rate had dropped to 23.2% from 31.5% a year earlier, water minister Nizar Baraka told a meeting on Tuesday, according to a royal palace statement.Rainfall was 70% lower than in an average year, he said.The country\u2019s second biggest dam, Al Masira, which serves the economic hub of Casablanca, is almost empty.The worst drought In more than two decades prompted authorities to ban the use of drinking water to clean streets or irrigate parks in cities and to stop dam water being used to irrigate some key farming areas.The decision took many farmers by surprise in the area of Taroudant in the Souss region, the main source of Morocco\u2019s fresh produce, which supplies supermarkets across Europe and is a major source of export revenue.\u201cStopping dam irrigation has sapped my investments \u2026 this year\u2019s production is in danger,\u201d Mbark N\u2019Ait Ali, a banana and vegetable farmer in Taroudant, said.Wells have dried up in the area, with farmers having to dig down to 400 meters with no guarantee of finding enough water, he added.This \u201cviolent drought\u201d had forced a reduction in the dam-irrigated area to 400,000 hectares from 750,000 hectares before the dry spell, agriculture minister Sadiki added.\u201cAutumn crops are at a critical condition \u2026 we pray for rain,\u201d he said.The ploughed area with rain-fed cereals has dropped this year to 2.3 million hectares, from 3.65 million hectares last year, which was also a dry year, he said.Morocco\u2019s statistics agency expects the cereals harvest to be less than average this year, meaning more wheat imports.As well as building waterways and new dams, Morocco plans eight new desalination plants powered by renewables.It aims to produce 1.3 billion cubic metres of fresh water from desalination by 2035.\u201cWe are afraid it will be too late when desalination will be ready to irrigate our farms,\u201d said N\u2019Ait Ali.\nReuters /Patience Ameh",

Obviously, you can see the drought here, how bad it is,\u201dthe first lady told reporters afterward.\u201cThe one source of water here feeds 12 villages and each village has approximately a thousand to 1,200 people.\u201d\n\u201cSo they are coming here, the people are coming to get water, they\u2019re bringing their livestock to get water. But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture.

        "Full_Content": "Riots erupted in Algerian desert city last weekend after months of water shortages left taps running dry and forced residents to queue to access water for their households.\nIn Tiaret, a central Algerian city of less than 200,000 located 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Algiers protestors wearing balaclavas set tires aflame and set up make-shift barricades blocking roads to protest their water being rationed, according to pictures and videos circulating on social media.\nThe unrest followed demands from President bdelmajid Tebboune to rectify the suffering. At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state.

Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell.

That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture. We hope the long rains will be enough,\u201dhe said.\nBiden sought to use her stature to help focus the world\u2019s attention on the worsening humanitarian crisis in East Africa by touring the drought-stricken area near Kenya\u2019s border with Tanzania.\nOn the nearly three-hour drive south of Nairobi, the capital, Biden\u2019s lengthy motorcade passed over dry river and creek beds.\nThrongs of people lined both sides of the motorcade route at various points, waving or using their cell phones to record the event.\nSome 4.4 million people in Kenya are facing high levels of food insecurity, with the number projected to rise to 5.4 million in March, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nAlready, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families\u2019 health and livelihood have died.\nMany of the people affected are farmers who have watched their crops wither and die, and their water sources run dry.\nNorthern Kenya, which is arid and semi-arid and is where pastoralist communities live, is most affected.\nThe country\u2019s agriculture sector heavily relies on rainfall, and the meteorological department is predicting delayed rains in the upcoming short rainy season that should begin in March.\nPresident William Ruto announced last October that his cabinet had lifted a decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops.\nThe decision came amid pressure from the U.S. government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.\nLast week, Ruto led the country in praying for rain.\nThe first lady has been highlighting the drought along with women and youth empowerment since arriving in Namibia last Wednesday.\nBiden had visited Kenya in 2011, when her husband, Joe Biden, was serving as vice president, to help raise awareness about what then was considered a severe famine.\nUS officials and aid organizations say the current drought is far worse.\nAbout halfway through drive to Lositeti, the first lady traded her black SUV for a smaller one more suited for the rugged terrain ahead.\nThe village was the final stop on a five-day, two-country visit that took her from Namibia, along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, to Kenya in the east.\nIt was her sixth visit overall to Africa, and her first as first lady, she travelled with her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, who is 29.\nBiden met throughout the week with young people, women and entrepreneurs as she promoted U.S., backed programs that teach about HIV/AIDS, preventing infection and safe sex practices.\nOther programs she visited help people learn skills to find jobs or start businesses to support their families.\nAlong the way, she said a comments that the strongest indication yet that her husband will seek to be re-elected in 2024.\nAsked if the only thing left to do was to decide on when and where to announce the campaign, she replied,\u201cPretty much.\u201d\nThe president, who later was asked about his wife\u2019s comments, offered a more measured response, saying he had\u201cother things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.\u201d\nyahoo news",

        "Full_Content": "Riots erupted in Algerian desert city last weekend after months of water shortages left taps running dry and forced residents to queue to access water for their households.\nIn Tiaret, a central Algerian city of less than 200,000 located 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Algiers protestors wearing balaclavas set tires aflame and set up make-shift barricades blocking roads to protest their water being rationed, according to pictures and videos circulating on social media.\nThe unrest followed demands from President bdelmajid Tebboune to rectify the suffering. At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state. Press freedom in the country has increasingly been curtailed and in recent years journalists have been imprisoned.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell. The driest February in Zimbabwe in her lifetime, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s seasonal monitor, put an end to that.\n\u201cWe have nothing in the fields, not a single grain.

That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "Morocco, where agriculture is a crucial sector, is heading for its sixth consecutive year of drought due to a drop in rainfall in recent months linked to climate change, Morocco\u2019s Minister of Equipment and Water, Nizar Baraka, said.\n\u201cWe have entered a critical phase after five consecutive years of drought that our country has never experienced before,\u201dsaid Mr Baraka at a press conference.\nRainfall has fallen by 67% in recent months compared with a year considered normal, and\u201cthe last three months (from October to December) show that we are heading for another year of drought\u201d,the minister added.\nIn Morocco, agriculture employs a third of the working-age population and accounts for 14% of the country\u2019s exports.\nWater stress in Morocco has been exacerbated by rising temperatures, which have increased water evaporation from dams.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture predicts an average temperature rise of 1.3 degrees Celsius by 2050.\nThe North African country\u2019s reservoirs are currently only 23.5% full, compared with 31% at the same time last year, which is\u201ca very dangerous situation\u201d,said Mr Baraka.\n\u201cOur hopes are high for the next three months, which are (usually) the rainiest in our country\u201d,he added.\nFailing that, local authorities in some regions will have to turn off the water supply, usually at night.\nIn the face of growing water stress, the authorities are betting on seawater desalination projects, such as the one due to start construction next month in Casablanca, the country\u2019s largest conurbation with over six million inhabitants.\nBy the end of 2027, Morocco plans to build seven desalination plants with a total capacity of 143 million cubic meters per year.\nThere are currently 12 desalination plants in the country, with a total capacity of 179.3 million cubic meters per year, according to official data.\nAfricanews/Hauwa M.",

        "Full_Content": "US first lady Jill Biden got an up-close look Sunday at thehistoric East Africa droughtas she walked along arid land and listened as some Maasai women described how their children and livestock are going hungry.\nShe appealed for more countriesto join the United Statesto help alleviate the suffering.\nSome areas of theHorn of Africahave endured five consecutive failed rainy seasons, meaning there was no rainfall or an insufficient amount to help farmers with their crops and livestock.\nAn upcoming sixth rainy season, beginning in March, is expected to be about the same or worse.\nBiden, who was on the final day of a five-day visit to Africa, toured an outreach center in the town operated by World Vision with support from UNICEF and the World Food Program.\nShe chatted with people who had brought their children to be screened for malnutrition and she participated in a discussion with a group of women, including a mother of 10 children, who shared their stories.\n\u201cThey talked about how their livestock are dying. Obviously, you can see the drought here, how bad it is,\u201dthe first lady told reporters afterward.\u201cThe one source of water here feeds 12 villages and each village has approximately a thousand to 1,200 people.\u201d\n\u201cSo they are coming here, the people are coming to get water, they\u2019re bringing their livestock to get water. But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture. We hope the long rains will be enough,\u201dhe said.\nBiden sought to use her stature to help focus the world\u2019s attention on the worsening humanitarian crisis in East Africa by touring the drought-stricken area near Kenya\u2019s border with Tanzania.\nOn the nearly three-hour drive south of Nairobi, the capital, Biden\u2019s lengthy motorcade passed over dry river and creek beds.\nThrongs of people lined both sides of the motorcade route at various points, waving or using their cell phones to record the event.\nSome 4.4 million people in Kenya are facing high levels of food insecurity, with the number projected to rise to 5.4 million in March, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nAlready, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families\u2019 health and livelihood have died.\nMany of the people affected are farmers who have watched their crops wither and die, and their water sources run dry.\nNorthern Kenya, which is arid and semi-arid and is where pastoralist communities live, is most affected.\nThe country\u2019s agriculture sector heavily relies on rainfall, and the meteorological department is predicting delayed rains in the upcoming short rainy season that should begin in March.\nPresident William Ruto announced last October that his cabinet had lifted a decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops.\nThe decision came amid pressure from the U.S. government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.\nLast week, Ruto led the country in praying for rain.\nThe first lady has been highlighting the drought along with women and youth empowerment since arriving in Namibia last Wednesday.\nBiden had visited Kenya in 2011, when her husband, Joe Biden, was serving as vice president, to help raise awareness about what then was considered a severe famine.\nUS officials and aid organizations say the current drought is far worse.\nAbout halfway through drive to Lositeti, the first lady traded her black SUV for a smaller one more suited for the rugged terrain ahead.\nThe village was the final stop on a five-day, two-country visit that took her from Namibia, along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, to Kenya in the east.\nIt was her sixth visit overall to Africa, and her first as first lady, she travelled with her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, who is 29.\nBiden met throughout the week with young people, women and entrepreneurs as she promoted U.S., backed programs that teach about HIV/AIDS, preventing infection and safe sex practices.\nOther programs she visited help people learn skills to find jobs or start businesses to support their families.\nAlong the way, she said a comments that the strongest indication yet that her husband will seek to be re-elected in 2024.\nAsked if the only thing left to do was to decide on when and where to announce the campaign, she replied,\u201cPretty much.\u201d\nThe president, who later was asked about his wife\u2019s comments, offered a more measured response, saying he had\u201cother things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.\u201d\nyahoo news",

        "Full_Content": "Riots erupted in Algerian desert city last weekend after months of water shortages left taps running dry and forced residents to queue to access water for their households.\nIn Tiaret, a central Algerian city of less than 200,000 located 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Algiers protestors wearing balaclavas set tires aflame and set up make-shift barricades blocking roads to protest their water being rationed, according to pictures and videos circulating on social media.\nThe unrest followed demands from President bdelmajid Tebboune to rectify the suffering. At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state. Press freedom in the country has increasingly been curtailed and in recent years journalists have been imprisoned.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

        "Full_Content": "Delicately and with intense concentration, Zanyiwe Ncube poured her small share of precious golden cooking oil into a plastic bottle at a food aid distribution site deep in rural Zimbabwe.\nHer relief at the handout paid for by the U.S. government as her southern African country deals with a severe drought was tempered when aid workers gently broke the news that this would be their last visit.\nNcube and her 7-month-old son she carried on her back were among 2,000 people who received rations of cooking oil, sorghum, peas and other supplies in the Mangwe district in southwestern Zimbabwe.\nThe food distribution is part of a programme funded by American aid agency USAID and rolled out by the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme.\nThey\u2019re aiming to help some of the 2.7 million people in rural Zimbabwe threatened with hunger because of the drought that has enveloped large parts of southern Africa since late last year.\nIt has scorched the crops that tens of millions of people grow themselves and rely on to survive, helped by what should be the rainy season.\nThey can rely on their crops and the weather less and less.\nThe drought in Zimbabwe, neighbouring Zambia and Malawi has reached crisis levels.\nZambia and Malawi have declared national disasters. Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell. The driest February in Zimbabwe in her lifetime, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s seasonal monitor, put an end to that.\n\u201cWe have nothing in the fields, not a single grain. Everything has dried up,\u201d she said.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says there are \u201coverlapping crises\u201d of extreme weather in eastern and southern Africa, with both regions lurching between storms and floods and heat and drought in the last year.\nIn southern Africa, an estimated 9 million people, half of them children, need help in Malawi.\nMore than 6 million in Zambia, 3 million of them children, are impacted by the drought, UNICEF said. That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

        "Full_Content": "Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema declared the drought a national disaster and emergency on Thursday, saying it had devastated food production and power generation, as the country struggles to recover a recent cholera epidemic.\nLike some of its neighbors, this southern African country is suffering from severe drought due to the El Nino phenomenon, which is worsening harsh weather conditions attributed in part to climate change.In a statement to the nation, Hichilema said he had asked security forces to focus more on food production. He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "Six consecutive years of drought have left Moroccan dams at critical levels, prompting a big drop in the area of land being irrigated, Morocco\u2019s water and agriculture ministers said.\nBy mid-January, Morocco\u2019s average dam filling rate had dropped to 23.2% from 31.5% a year earlier, water minister Nizar Baraka told a meeting on Tuesday, according to a royal palace statement.Rainfall was 70% lower than in an average year, he said.The country\u2019s second biggest dam, Al Masira, which serves the economic hub of Casablanca, is almost empty.The worst drought In more than two decades prompted authorities to ban the use of drinking water to clean streets or irrigate parks in cities and to stop dam water being used to irrigate some key farming areas.The decision took many farmers by surprise in the area of Taroudant in the Souss region, the main source of Morocco\u2019s fresh produce, which supplies supermarkets across Europe and is a major source of export revenue.\u201cStopping dam irrigation has sapped my investments \u2026 this year\u2019s production is in danger,\u201d Mbark N\u2019Ait Ali, a banana and vegetable farmer in Taroudant, said.Wells have dried up in the area, with farmers having to dig down to 400 meters with no guarantee of finding enough water, he added.This \u201cviolent drought\u201d had forced a reduction in the dam-irrigated area to 400,000 hectares from 750,000 hectares before the dry spell, agriculture minister Sadiki added.\u201cAutumn crops are at a critical condition \u2026 we pray for rain,\u201d he said.The ploughed area with rain-fed cereals has dropped this year to 2.3 million hectares, from 3.65 million hectares last year, which was also a dry year, he said.Morocco\u2019s statistics agency expects the cereals harvest to be less than average this year, meaning more wheat imports.As well as building waterways and new dams, Morocco plans eight new desalination plants powered by renewables.It aims to produce 1.3 billion cubic metres of fresh water from desalination by 2035.\u201cWe are afraid it will be too late when desalination will be ready to irrigate our farms,\u201d said N\u2019Ait Ali.\nReuters /Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "US first lady Jill Biden got an up-close look Sunday at thehistoric East Africa droughtas she walked along arid land and listened as some Maasai women described how their children and livestock are going hungry.\nShe appealed for more countriesto join the United Statesto help alleviate the suffering.\nSome areas of theHorn of Africahave endured five consecutive failed rainy seasons, meaning there was no rainfall or an insufficient amount to help farmers with their crops and livestock.\nAn upcoming sixth rainy season, beginning in March, is expected to be about the same or worse.\nBiden, who was on the final day of a five-day visit to Africa, toured an outreach center in the town operated by World Vision with support from UNICEF and the World Food Program.\nShe chatted with people who had brought their children to be screened for malnutrition and she participated in a discussion with a group of women, including a mother of 10 children, who shared their stories.\n\u201cThey talked about how their livestock are dying. Obviously, you can see the drought here, how bad it is,\u201dthe first lady told reporters afterward.\u201cThe one source of water here feeds 12 villages and each village has approximately a thousand to 1,200 people.\u201d\n\u201cSo they are coming here, the people are coming to get water, they\u2019re bringing their livestock to get water. But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture. We hope the long rains will be enough,\u201dhe said.\nBiden sought to use her stature to help focus the world\u2019s attention on the worsening humanitarian crisis in East Africa by touring the drought-stricken area near Kenya\u2019s border with Tanzania.\nOn the nearly three-hour drive south of Nairobi, the capital, Biden\u2019s lengthy motorcade passed over dry river and creek beds.\nThrongs of people lined both sides of the motorcade route at various points, waving or using their cell phones to record the event.\nSome 4.4 million people in Kenya are facing high levels of food insecurity, with the number projected to rise to 5.4 million in March, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nAlready, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families\u2019 health and livelihood have died.\nMany of the people affected are farmers who have watched their crops wither and die, and their water sources run dry.\nNorthern Kenya, which is arid and semi-arid and is where pastoralist communities live, is most affected.\nThe country\u2019s agriculture sector heavily relies on rainfall, and the meteorological department is predicting delayed rains in the upcoming short rainy season that should begin in March.\nPresident William Ruto announced last October that his cabinet had lifted a decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops.\nThe decision came amid pressure from the U.S. government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.\nLast week, Ruto led the country in praying for rain.\nThe first lady has been highlighting the drought along with women and youth empowerment since arriving in Namibia last Wednesday.\nBiden had visited Kenya in 2011, when her husband, Joe Biden, was serving as vice president, to help raise awareness about what then was considered a severe famine.\nUS officials and aid organizations say the current drought is far worse.\nAbout halfway through drive to Lositeti, the first lady traded her black SUV for a smaller one more suited for the rugged terrain ahead.\nThe village was the final stop on a five-day, two-country visit that took her from Namibia, along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, to Kenya in the east.\nIt was her sixth visit overall to Africa, and her first as first lady, she travelled with her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, who is 29.\nBiden met throughout the week with young people, women and entrepreneurs as she promoted U.S., backed programs that teach about HIV/AIDS, preventing infection and safe sex practices.\nOther programs she visited help people learn skills to find jobs or start businesses to support their families.\nAlong the way, she said a comments that the strongest indication yet that her husband will seek to be re-elected in 2024.\nAsked if the only thing left to do was to decide on when and where to announce the campaign, she replied,\u201cPretty much.\u201d\nThe president, who later was asked about his wife\u2019s comments, offered a more measured response, saying he had\u201cother things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.\u201d\nyahoo news",

At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state.

Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell. The driest February in Zimbabwe in her lifetime, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s seasonal monitor, put an end to that.\n\u201cWe have nothing in the fields, not a single grain. Everything has dried up,\u201d she said.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says there are \u201coverlapping crises\u201d of extreme weather in eastern and southern Africa, with both regions lurching between storms and floods and heat and drought in the last year.\nIn southern Africa, an estimated 9 million people, half of them children, need help in Malawi.\nMore than 6 million in Zambia, 3 million of them children, are impacted by the drought, UNICEF said. That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

For Neno, it has been hit hard. So, the president\u2019s declaration means other people are going to come in now, lifting the hand of government where it wasn\u2019t necessarily able to do it.

        "Full_Content": "Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema declared the drought a national disaster and emergency on Thursday, saying it had devastated food production and power generation, as the country struggles to recover a recent cholera epidemic.\nLike some of its neighbors, this southern African country is suffering from severe drought due to the El Nino phenomenon, which is worsening harsh weather conditions attributed in part to climate change.In a statement to the nation, Hichilema said he had asked security forces to focus more on food production. He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

        "Full_Content": "Six consecutive years of drought have left Moroccan dams at critical levels, prompting a big drop in the area of land being irrigated, Morocco\u2019s water and agriculture ministers said.\nBy mid-January, Morocco\u2019s average dam filling rate had dropped to 23.2% from 31.5% a year earlier, water minister Nizar Baraka told a meeting on Tuesday, according to a royal palace statement.Rainfall was 70% lower than in an average year, he said.The country\u2019s second biggest dam, Al Masira, which serves the economic hub of Casablanca, is almost empty.The worst drought In more than two decades prompted authorities to ban the use of drinking water to clean streets or irrigate parks in cities and to stop dam water being used to irrigate some key farming areas.The decision took many farmers by surprise in the area of Taroudant in the Souss region, the main source of Morocco\u2019s fresh produce, which supplies supermarkets across Europe and is a major source of export revenue.\u201cStopping dam irrigation has sapped my investments \u2026 this year\u2019s production is in danger,\u201d Mbark N\u2019Ait Ali, a banana and vegetable farmer in Taroudant, said.Wells have dried up in the area, with farmers having to dig down to 400 meters with no guarantee of finding enough water, he added.This \u201cviolent drought\u201d had forced a reduction in the dam-irrigated area to 400,000 hectares from 750,000 hectares before the dry spell, agriculture minister Sadiki added.\u201cAutumn crops are at a critical condition \u2026 we pray for rain,\u201d he said.The ploughed area with rain-fed cereals has dropped this year to 2.3 million hectares, from 3.65 million hectares last year, which was also a dry year, he said.Morocco\u2019s statistics agency expects the cereals harvest to be less than average this year, meaning more wheat imports.As well as building waterways and new dams, Morocco plans eight new desalination plants powered by renewables.It aims to produce 1.3 billion cubic metres of fresh water from desalination by 2035.\u201cWe are afraid it will be too late when desalination will be ready to irrigate our farms,\u201d said N\u2019Ait Ali.\nReuters /Patience Ameh",

Obviously, you can see the drought here, how bad it is,\u201dthe first lady told reporters afterward.\u201cThe one source of water here feeds 12 villages and each village has approximately a thousand to 1,200 people.\u201d\n\u201cSo they are coming here, the people are coming to get water, they\u2019re bringing their livestock to get water. But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture.

        "Full_Content": "Riots erupted in Algerian desert city last weekend after months of water shortages left taps running dry and forced residents to queue to access water for their households.\nIn Tiaret, a central Algerian city of less than 200,000 located 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Algiers protestors wearing balaclavas set tires aflame and set up make-shift barricades blocking roads to protest their water being rationed, according to pictures and videos circulating on social media.\nThe unrest followed demands from President bdelmajid Tebboune to rectify the suffering. At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state.

Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell.

That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they\u2019re having a hard time,\u201dshe said.\nBiden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering,\u201cbut we cannot be the only ones.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,\u201dshe said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian\u2019s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,\u201dshe said.\nMeg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what\u2019s going on in the region but\u201cit\u2019s different when you just see it.\u201d\nUnderscoring Biden, Whitman said that\u201ceveryone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMembers of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.\nNearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nA Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.\n\u201cThe short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture. We hope the long rains will be enough,\u201dhe said.\nBiden sought to use her stature to help focus the world\u2019s attention on the worsening humanitarian crisis in East Africa by touring the drought-stricken area near Kenya\u2019s border with Tanzania.\nOn the nearly three-hour drive south of Nairobi, the capital, Biden\u2019s lengthy motorcade passed over dry river and creek beds.\nThrongs of people lined both sides of the motorcade route at various points, waving or using their cell phones to record the event.\nSome 4.4 million people in Kenya are facing high levels of food insecurity, with the number projected to rise to 5.4 million in March, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.\nAlready, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families\u2019 health and livelihood have died.\nMany of the people affected are farmers who have watched their crops wither and die, and their water sources run dry.\nNorthern Kenya, which is arid and semi-arid and is where pastoralist communities live, is most affected.\nThe country\u2019s agriculture sector heavily relies on rainfall, and the meteorological department is predicting delayed rains in the upcoming short rainy season that should begin in March.\nPresident William Ruto announced last October that his cabinet had lifted a decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops.\nThe decision came amid pressure from the U.S. government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.\nLast week, Ruto led the country in praying for rain.\nThe first lady has been highlighting the drought along with women and youth empowerment since arriving in Namibia last Wednesday.\nBiden had visited Kenya in 2011, when her husband, Joe Biden, was serving as vice president, to help raise awareness about what then was considered a severe famine.\nUS officials and aid organizations say the current drought is far worse.\nAbout halfway through drive to Lositeti, the first lady traded her black SUV for a smaller one more suited for the rugged terrain ahead.\nThe village was the final stop on a five-day, two-country visit that took her from Namibia, along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, to Kenya in the east.\nIt was her sixth visit overall to Africa, and her first as first lady, she travelled with her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, who is 29.\nBiden met throughout the week with young people, women and entrepreneurs as she promoted U.S., backed programs that teach about HIV/AIDS, preventing infection and safe sex practices.\nOther programs she visited help people learn skills to find jobs or start businesses to support their families.\nAlong the way, she said a comments that the strongest indication yet that her husband will seek to be re-elected in 2024.\nAsked if the only thing left to do was to decide on when and where to announce the campaign, she replied,\u201cPretty much.\u201d\nThe president, who later was asked about his wife\u2019s comments, offered a more measured response, saying he had\u201cother things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.\u201d\nyahoo news",

        "Full_Content": "Riots erupted in Algerian desert city last weekend after months of water shortages left taps running dry and forced residents to queue to access water for their households.\nIn Tiaret, a central Algerian city of less than 200,000 located 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Algiers protestors wearing balaclavas set tires aflame and set up make-shift barricades blocking roads to protest their water being rationed, according to pictures and videos circulating on social media.\nThe unrest followed demands from President bdelmajid Tebboune to rectify the suffering. At a council of ministers meeting last week, he implored his cabinet to implement \u201cemergency measures\u201d in Tiaret. Several government ministers were later sent to \u201cask for an apology from the population\u201d and to promise that access to drinking water would be restored.\nPolitical Implications and Climate Impact\nThe rioting comes as Tebboune is expected to vie for a second term as president of the oil-rich nation \u2014 Africa\u2019s largest by area. Northern Africa has been among the world\u2019s worst-hit regions by climate change. A multi-year drought has drained critical reservoirs and reduced the amount of rainfall that has historically replenished them.\nREAD ALSO: Thousands of Afghan children impacted by flash floods\nThe region, located on a semi-arid high desert plateau increasingly plagued by extreme heat, gets its water from three dammed reservoirs that are shrinking as temperatures spike and less rain falls.\nThe reservoirs have become less functional due to a \u201cdeath of volume\u201d and are reduced to 20% of their capacity, agricultural engineer Said Ouarad said.\nThe region\u2019s groundwater aquifers have for years not been able to recharge due to an absence of rain, he added.\nLong-term and Short-term Solutions\nAlgeria\u2019s long-term solution would be to pipe water from larger dams further north and south from Tiaret and shift to alternative supplies, including desalination plants that the country has heavily invested in.\nREAD ALSO: Extreme weather stirs cholera outbreaks in parts of east and southern Africa\nBut in the meantime, officials are trying to import water from nearby sources. Cosider, the public company responsible for the region\u2019s water infrastructure, hopes to finish new pipelines by July to bring groundwater to Tiaret from wells 20 miles (32 kilometers) away. Until then, the company is trucking large cisterns of water into the city, a company official not authorized to speak on the matter told The Associated Press.\nCurrent Situation and Media Coverage\n\u201cTiaret and three surrounding municipalities have suffered from this water shortage for months,\u201d he said. \u201cA calm has returned but the situation remains tense.\u201d\nNews about the tensions has spread on social media but garnered little news coverage in Algeria, where many papers and television stations rely on advertising revenue from the state. Press freedom in the country has increasingly been curtailed and in recent years journalists have been imprisoned.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

Zimbabwe could be on the brink of doing the same.\nIt has reached Botswana and Angola to the west, and Mozambique and Madagascar to the east.\nA year ago, much of this region was drenched by deadly tropical storms and floods.\nIt is in the midst of a vicious weather cycle: Damned by too much rain, then by not enough, it\u2019s a story of the climatic extremes that scientists say are becoming more frequent and more damaging, especially for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\nIn Mangwe, the young and the old lined up for food, some with donkey carts to carry home whatever they might get, others with wheelbarrows.\nThose waiting their turn sat on the dusty ground.\nNcube, 39, would normally be harvesting her crops now, food for her, her two children and a niece she also looks after.\nMaybe there would even be a little extra to sell. The driest February in Zimbabwe in her lifetime, according to the World Food Programme\u2019s seasonal monitor, put an end to that.\n\u201cWe have nothing in the fields, not a single grain.

That\u2019s nearly half of Malawi\u2019s population and 30% of Zambia\u2019s.\nWhile man-made climate change has spurred more erratic weather globally, there is something else parching southern Africa this year.\nEl Ni\u00f1o, the naturally occurring climatic phenomenon that warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years, has varied effects on the world\u2019s weather.\nIn southern Africa, it means below-average rainfall, sometimes drought, and is being blamed for the current situation.\nThe impact is more severe for people like those in Mangwe, where it\u2019s notoriously arid and people grow the cereal grain sorghum and pearl millet, crops that are drought resistant and offer a chance at harvests.\nThis year, even they failed to withstand the conditions.\nFrancesca Erdelmann, the World Food Programme\u2019s country director for Zimbabwe, said last year\u2019s harvest was bad, but this season is even worse.\n\u201cThis is not a normal circumstance,\u201d she said.\nThe first few months of the year are traditionally the \u201clean months\u201d when households run short as they wait for the new harvest.\nHowever, there is little hope for replenishment this year.\nMultiple aid agencies warned last year of the impending disaster.\nSince then, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has said that 1 million of the 2.2 million hectares of his country\u2019s staple corn crop have been destroyed.\nMalawian President Lazarus Chakwera has appealed for $200 million in humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2.7 million rural folk struggling in Zimbabwe is not even the full picture.\nA nationwide crop assessment is underway and authorities are \u201cdreading\u201d the results, with the number needing help likely to skyrocket, said the WFP\u2019s Erdelmann.\nUSAID\u2019s Famine Early Warning System estimated that 20 million people would require food relief in southern Africa in the first few months of 2024.\nWith this year\u2019s harvest a write-off, millions in Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar won\u2019t be able to feed themselves well into 2025.\nMany just won\u2019t get that help as aid agencies also have limited resources amid a global hunger crisis and a cut in humanitarian funding by governments.\nAs the WFP officials made their last visit to Mangwe, Ncube was already calculating how long the food might last her.\nShe said she hoped it would be long enough to avert her greatest fear, that her youngest child would slip into malnutrition even before his first birthday.\nAfrican news/Jide Johnson.",

He said 84 of the country\u2019s 116 districts were affected by the prolonged drought and that authorities would take food from areas where there is a surplus and distribute it to areas in need.Additionally, Zambia plans to increase food imports and mobilizes UN agencies and local businesses to help. He added that the drought has destroyed about 1 million hectares of the 2.2 million hectares planted in corn, the staple crop.\u201cThis drought is having devastating consequences on many sectors such as agriculture, water availability, and energy supply, jeopardizing our national food security and the livelihoods of millions of people. \u201cDrought is expected to continue until March, affecting more than a million of our agricultural households,\u201d said Hichilema.Electricity production has not been spared, with the country expecting a deficit of around 430 megawatts \u201cpotentially reaching 520 megawatts by December\u201d, he said, due to the falling level water in the country\u2019s main source of hydroelectric power, the Kariba Dam, which it shares with its neighbor, Zimbabwe.To cope with this situation, the country will import electricity and ration the supply for its approximately 20 million inhabitants.Zambia was recently hit by one of its worst outbreaks of cholera, which killed more than 400 people and infected more than 10,000.Some Zambians, tired of the persistence of crises, have invented songs calling the coronavirus and cholera epidemics, as well as the current drought, a \u201dtriple tragedy\u201d, he said.Although many countries in southern Africa have not yet declared a national disaster, they are also in a dire situation due to the influence of the El Nino weather phenomenon, according to the UN agency, the Food Program Global.Parts of Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are experiencing the driest February in 40 years, while severe rainfall shortages have been recorded in southern Malawi, eastern Angola, and some parts of Mozambique, WFP said in a bulletin released this week.The United States Agency for International Development, the U.S. government\u2019s foreign aid arm, has estimated, through its network of famine early warning systems, that 20 million people in Africa Australia will need food aid between January and March.\nAccording to USAID, many people living in areas of greatest concern, such as Zimbabwe, southern Malawi, parts of Mozambique and southern Madagascar, will not be able to feed themselves until the start of the year 2025 due to El Ni\u00f1o.\nAfricanews/Patience Ameh",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea.

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones.

Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces.

Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses.

Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea.

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones.

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

Pregnant women get dehydrated easily and quickly.\n\u201cFor pregnant women in their first trimester, extreme heat waves could cause changes in the system where the body is forming the baby.\n\u201cThis period is the time that the organs are formed, when the foetus is ill, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and early birth, which might make the outcome of the pregnancy unpalatable to the mother.\n\u201cFor the baby born prematurely, it causes more difficulty in care as cost and survival is always guarded depending on the age.\u201d\nThe don urged pregnant women during this period to work in a well-ventilated and cool environment and refrain from walking in the sun.\nHe also advised them to wear light clothes and take cold baths as much as possible.\nThe maternal health experts urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun, take water intermittently and stay in well-ventilated areas during this period.\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says heat waves happen when the temperature is higher than usual for several days.\nIt noted that heat waves can be extremely uncomfortable and pose serious health risks for infants, children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nThe don also said walking in the sun for too long should be discouraged, noting that if such occurs, water should be taken intermittently.\nAn Honorary Consultant Obstetrician Gynaecologist at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Prof Ishaq Abdul, said that the body of pregnant women needs 30 per cent more water due to the increase in blood volume, noting that dehydration caused by the heat wave can negatively affect their body mechanisms.\nHe urged pregnant women to avoid walking in the sun during heat waves,\u201cIn mild forms, there might not be any problem as a pregnant woman can survive but there is a need to drink water intermittently and avoid the heat. Walking about in the heat can compound dehydration, especially if there is already so much water loss while indoors.\u201d\nAbdul urged communities and families to support pregnant women by ensuring that they have access to a cool environment at home and workplace.\n\u201cHeat wave is a serious issue and there is a need to make the society better in terms of having constant electricity supply so that there will be fans and cooling systems in homes and offices,\u201dhe added.\nAbdul advised parents and caregivers to give children more water during this period, warning them to avoid giving juices because it can lead to diarrhoea. The best thing is to drink water to stay dehydrated.",

Heatwaves can affect anybody and I think that\u2019s the first thing people need to know.\n\u201cHeatwave is not likely to worsen hypertension. If anything will worsen hypertension, it will be cold and not heat.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s important we make it known to people because there is a completely wrong notion about hypertension. So, any little thing that happens in society, they will say it will worsen hypertension.\n\u201cThere is so much stress in the country, everywhere is hot, and there is no power supply. Now, people will say that if you are hypertensive and there is a heatwave, you are in trouble, it\u2019s not true.\n\u201cWhat happens with the heatwave is that, yes, it\u2019s quite hot and people are likely to sweat more than before, and then it can cause dehydration, but it will not make hypertension worse.\n\u201cBut if we have a serious winter, if somebody is not taking his antihypertensive medication and he has a serious cold, the blood pressure would go up more than during the heat period. \u201d\nThe cardiologist pointed out that people working in the sun and not taking enough water might suffer kidney stones.\nThe physician stressed the need for people to drink enough water so that their urine will not become concentrated and predisposes them to kidney stones.\nHe added,\u201cThe area that I will even want to talk about is drinking water and avoiding things like kidney stones, especially people who work under the sun.\n\u201cPeople need to drink more water so that their urine will not become concentrated and then predisposing them to kidney stones. So that\u2019s a better argument to put, rather than saying that heatwaves worsen hypertension.\u201d",

They need to be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\u201cRemember that extreme heat can be dangerous, So, If you or someone else is experiencing symptoms such as heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, confusion or inability to walk or talk properly, it is essential to seek medical help immediately.\n\u201cHeat-related illnesses can escalate quickly and it could be life-threatening, so early intervention is crucial.\u201d\nCole-Adeife highlighted certain measures to protect oneself and others from heat-related health emergencies like heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\u201cStay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even if you do not feel thirsty. Aim for 2.5 to 3.5 litres of water daily and avoid drinks with caffeine, high sugar content or alcohol, as they can contribute to dehydration.\n\u201cUse fans and air conditioning to cool indoor spaces. Take cool baths frequently to lower your body temperature. However, baths should be without soap if more than two times a day to avoid drying out the skin.\n\u201cOpen windows at home to allow for cross ventilation. Invest in a rechargeable fan, considering the concurrent electricity shortage in the country.\n\u201cWear loose, lightweight, and light-coloured clothing to reflect the sun and allow your body to cool efficiently. Avoid dark-coloured or thick clothing. These are some tips people can take to stay safe during the heatwave,\u201dshe said.\nThe Dermatologist urged Nigerians to limit outdoor activities during peak sun hours (usually between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) and Identify public places like shopping malls with air conditioning, where one could escape the heat.\nShe said it was important to use sun protection items such as hat to protect the face and neck as well as sunscreen to protect the skin from harmful Ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\u201cNow is not the time to use too many skin care products. Stick to soap, a lightweight moisturizer or none. Then, keep an eye on elderly family members, neighbours, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, as they are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Check up on them regularly and encourage them to avoid going outdoors for too long and when indoors they should leave windows and doors open and use fans,\u201dshe advised.\nNAN/Wumi",

        "Full_Content": "Extreme temperatures have continued to hit much of Europe as experts warn that Western France is facing a\u00a0\u201cheat apocalypse\u201c.\nBlazes in Spain, Portugal, and Greece have forced thousands to flee.\nRecord temperatures are also expected in parts of the UK, which has its first-ever red extreme heat warning in place.\nIn France, temperatures could reach record levels in 15 regions of the southwest, with firefighters battling wildfires and thousands forced to evacuate.\nWildfires in recent days have forced over 16,000 people to flee the area, with emergency shelters set up for evacuees.\nGironde, a popular tourist region in the southwest, has been hit particularly badly, with firefighters battling to control fires that have destroyed over 14,000 hectares (34,000 acres) of land since last Tuesday.\nJean-Luc Gleyze, president of the Gironde region, told the BBC the fires had continued to grow in La-Teste-de-Buch and Landiras because of the hot and windy weather, making it difficult for firefighters to contain them.\n\u201cThey have to fight against this fire which is growing and growing, sometimes getting very, very high,\u201d\u00a0he said.\nMore villages will have to be evacuated, he added.\nThe heatwave has prompted warnings of what one meteorologist described to AFP news agency as\u00a0\u201can apocalypse of heat\u201d\u00a0in some areas of the southwest.\nIn Spain and Portugal, more than 1,000 deaths have been attributed to the heat in recent days.\nIn the central province of Zamora, where a fire has been blazing since the weekend, the body of a shepherd was found in the Sierra de la Culebra mountain range.\nAlso read:Wildfires spread as heatwave grips the Mediterranean\nHe is the second fatal casualty of the Zamora fire after a 62-year-old firefighter was killed on Sunday.\nWildfires have also broken out in the Mijas hills near Malaga, as well as Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Galicia and Extremadura.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is due to visit the latter region on Monday.\nFires in Portugal have been largely contained, despite temperatures there hitting 47C (116F) on Thursday \u2013 a record for July.\nBut one-third of the mainland still remains at extreme risk of fire, according to the national meteorological office IPMA.\nThis is due to severe or extreme drought conditions virtually everywhere, the BBC\u2019s Portugal correspondent Alison Roberts says.\nAfter the trauma of June 2017, when 66 lives were lost in fires, emergency, and civil defense commanders\u2019 top priority has been to act early to protect life, leading to the evacuation of over 860 people from their homes across the north and south of the country, she adds.\nThe heatwave is the second to hit parts of southwest Europe in recent weeks.\nHeatwaves have become more frequent, more intense, and last longer because of human-induced climate change.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\nEnrique Sanchez, the Dean of the Faculty of Environmental Sciences and Biochemistry at The University of Castilla-La Mancha in Spain told the BBC that heatwaves would soon become the norm.\n\u201cIn the long term, I mean in the following years, there is no way that the temperatures are going to [not] increase, so heat wave events will become more and more common\u2026 all along Europe,\u201dhe said.\nZainab Sa\u2019id",
